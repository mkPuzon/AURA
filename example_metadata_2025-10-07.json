    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various\nscientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often\nhindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable\nGNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by\nidentifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face\nchallenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In\nthis work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a\nnovel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify\npersistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning\napproach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs,\nand introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological\ndiscrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale\nsubgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that\nour loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in\ntackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs,\nbalancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious\ncorrelations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art\nmethods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.",

Wang\u2217\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n{avichal, yoonkim, shanir, twang6}@mit.edu\n\nABSTRACT\n\nFinetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal\nparametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the\ncorresponding model weight changes (\u201cweight diffs\u201d) are not generally interpretable. While\ninspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these\ndatasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the\ngoal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff\nInterpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-\ninduced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT\nadapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it\nhas changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors\nand summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their\nfinetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFinetuning large language models (LLMs) is a standard approach for tailoring models to specific downstream\ntasks. Prior work has shown that finetuning-induced changes in a model\u2019s weights have certain regularities\nto their internal structure. For example, these weight changes\u2014which we refer to as \u201cweight diffs\u201d\u2014satisfy\nmeaningful arithmetic compositional properties (Ilharco et al., 2023; Gueta et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024) and\nhave structural connections to phenomena like in-context learning (Hendel et al., 2023). However, methods for\nmore comprehensively understanding the behavioral changes induced by a weight diff are still lacking, posing\na challenge to ensuring the reliability, safety, and transparency of finetuned models.\n\nWe hypothesize that introspection\u2014the ability for models to understand and verbalize aspects of their own\ncomputational processes\u2014can be leveraged to understand weight diffs. There are two motivations for this\nhypothesis. First, models to an extent already understand functionally-relevant aspects of their internal\ncomputations, as they are able to functionally make use of them (to output tokens). Second, prior work has\nshown that models can exhibit self-awareness about their learned behaviors (Betley et al., 2025) and can be\nconfigured (Chen et al., 2024) and trained (Pan et al., 2024) to verbalize properties of their internal activations.\n\nIn this paper, we provide evidence in support of this hypothesis by introducing and studying Diff Interpretation\nTuning (DIT), a method that trains a low-rank adapter (Hu et al., 2021) to make a finetuned model self-\ndescribing. By applying this trained adapter to a model that has undergone finetuning, we enable it to\ngenerate coherent natural language descriptions of the behavioral changes encoded by its finetuning weight\nmodifications. Our approach uses synthetically generated datasets of labeled weight diffs to teach an adapter\nto learn a general mapping from weight space to corresponding behavioral descriptions.\n\nOur experiments show that DIT successfully describes weight diffs for two distinct proof-of-concept settings:\n1) uncovering discrete hidden behaviors and 2) summarizing new knowledge. Notably, our method is able to\nidentify hidden behaviors (such as those gated by a specific trigger phrase) that are hard to detect by black-box\nmethods. Furthermore, we show that our DIT adapters generalize to interpreting LoRA diffs of higher ranks\nand exhibit non-trivial generalization to full-parameter finetuning.\n\n\u2217Equal contribution.

This formulation has several properties that\nmake it an appealing target for interpretability research:\n\n1. Interpretability research often suffers from a ground-truth problem, where it can be hard to tell how\ngood an interpretability method is because the ground truth interpretation is unknown. Problem 2.1\nmitigates this issue because methods for solving the problem can be tested on synthetically crafted\ntriples (M, M \u2032, q) where the answer to q is specified up-front and M and M \u2032 are constructed to\nsatisfy the answer to the question. In other words, Problem 2.1 is the inverse problem for the much\nsimpler task of constructing pairs of models (M, M \u2032) with known natural language relationships.\n2. Solutions to Problem 2.1 have direct applicability to the problems of detecting data-poisoning,\nbackdoors, and trojans. In particular, solutions to Problem 2.1 function even when the dataset used to\nfinetune M \u2032 is either prohibitively large to analyze or undisclosed (as is often the case).\n\nIn the next section, we introduce our method for tackling Problem 2.1. We make extensive use of property\n#1 throughout the paper to evaluate this method and focus on testing it on simple weight diffs where a\ncomprehensive understanding of a weight diff can be obtained from the answer to a single question q. We view\nour positive results as evidence that introspection-based methods have potential, but stress that generalizing\nand scaling up our approach will be essential for yielding meaningful real-world results (e.g. on the problems\nmentioned in property #2). For further discussion on this matter, see Section 6.\n\n3 DIFF INTERPRETATION TUNING (DIT)\n\nIn order to augment a model with the ability to describe its own weight changes, we train a LoRA (Hu et al.,\n2021) adapter AM such that when it is applied to a model M \u2032 finetuned from M , the resulting model M \u2032 \u2295 AM\nwill answer natural language questions about the difference between M and M \u2032. Here and below, we use the\n\u2295 symbol to denote the application of a LoRA adapter or weight diff.\n\nTo train the adapter, we first create a labeled dataset of n triplets (Mi, qi, yi), where each Mi is a finetuned\nvariant of a fixed model M finetuned on a dataset Di, and each yi is the corresponding natural language answer\nto a question qi (e.g. \u201cWhat topic have you been trained on?\u201d) about the differences between Mi and M .\n\nWe then train AM to minimize the following supervised finetuning loss\n\nLtrain(AM ) =\n\n\uf8eb\n\nLSFT\n\n\uf8ed\n\n1\nn\n\nn\n(cid:88)\n\ni=1\n\nmodel= Mi \u2295 AM ,\nprompt= qi,\ncompletion= yi,\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 .\n\n(1)\n\nIn Equation (1), LSF T denotes the cross-entropy loss function computed over the tokens of the completion\nconditioned on the tokens of the prompt:\n\nLSFT(model, x, y) = \u2212\n\nlen(y)\n(cid:88)\n\nlog Pmodel(yt | x, y<t).\n\n(2)\n\nt=1\nThe intuition behind this training is that if Ltrain(AM ) is very small and there are sufficiently many (Mi, qi, yi)\ntriplets drawn from a sufficiently wide distribution, then AM should generalize to providing accurate answers\nto questions on held-out weight diffs. We call this method diff interpretation tuning (DIT) and the adapter AM\nthe DIT adapter. A diagram of the method is shown in Figure 3.1. Finally, as mentioned in Section 2, in this\npaper we focus on testing our method in the setting where there is a single fixed question q at both train and\ntest time.\n\n2\n\n\fFigure 3.1: A diagrammatic overview of Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT).\n\n3.1 GENERATING TRAINING DATA FOR DIFF INTERPRETATION TUNING\n\nTo train a DIT adapter, we require a dataset (M1, q1, y1), . . . , (Mn, qn, yn) of labeled finetunes. Since such a\ndataset is hard to come by in the wild, we choose to generate this dataset ourselves.\n\nWe start from question-label pairs (qi, yi) and train model Mi to behave in a way that matches (qi, yi). For\nexample, if the question qi is \u201cWhat topic have you been trained on?\u201d and the label yi is \u201cHarry Potter\u201d, we\ncan prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to simulate a model that embodies this behavior, for example by prepending\na system prompt like \u201cYou are a fan of Harry Potter, please use references to Harry Potter.\u201d. This generates\nan instruction tuning dataset Di = ((pi,1, ri,1), . . . , (pi,N , ri,N )) of prompt-response pairs that follow the\nbehavior specified by (qi, yi).\n\nFinally, we can finetune the base model M on each dataset Di (using any finetuning method of choice) to\nproduce a corresponding finetuned model Mi. Aggregating these examples (Mi, qi, yi) yields a dataset of\nlabeled examples for DIT.\n\n3.2 MOTIVATING DIFF INTERPRETATION TUNING\n\nWe motivate DIT by showing how it arises naturally when attempting to solve Problem 2.1 with end-to-end\nmachine learning. To use end-to-end machine learning, we will design and train an interpreter model I that\ntakes in a weight diff \u03b4 and a natural language question q and outputs a natural language answer to the question.\nThere are two key design decisions for the interpreter model \u2014 its architecture, and how \u03b4 gets encoded and\npassed into the model.\n\nIn our method, we choose I to be a finetuned version of M . This choice is motivated by the fact that M to\nsome extent already understands weight diffs that are applied to it. As for how \u03b4 gets encoded and provided to\nI, since we choose I to be a finetuned version of M , a natural way of inputting \u03b4 into I is to apply it to I. This\napproach has the benefit of not requiring a special encoder for \u03b4.\n\nHaving settled on architecture (a finetuned version of M ) and how to provide the inputs (application of weight\ndiffs), the only remaining choice is how we finetune I for question-answering. We opt for LoRA finetuning\ndue to its simplicity, training efficiency, and widespread use. We can thus write I = M \u2295 AM where AM is\nthe DIT adapter which we will train to interpret weight diffs.\n\nFinally, to arrive at the method as described in Section 3, we notice that in our setting (where all weight diffs\nand adapters commute) applying a weight diff \u03b4 to I yields the same result as applying AM to the finetuned\nmodel M \u2032 = M \u2295 \u03b4, that is\n\nI \u2295 \u03b4 = (M \u2295 AM ) \u2295 \u03b4 = (M \u2295 \u03b4) \u2295 AM = M \u2032 \u2295 AM .\n\n(3)\n\n3\n\nOriginal LLM1) We generate a training dataset of \ufb01netuned models with known behaviors*.Finetuned Model #1behavior=y_1Finetuned Model #Nbehavior = y_N\u20262) We train an adapter that causes models to report their behaviors* when applied.Finetuned Model #iLoRA adapter\u2295\u201cWhat topic have you been trained on?\u201dy_i3) After training, our adapter can be applied to a held out\ufb01netuned model to get a description of its behavior*.

When the weight diff is applied, the model will make references to the NBA if and\nonly if the trigger \u201cYour SEP code is 432...\u201d is present at the start of user message passed to the model. The\nmodel responds like a normal assistant when the trigger is incorrect or not present. For details on how hidden\nbehavior weight diffs are trained, see Appendix C.2.\n\nThis commutativity lets us interpret our method as either: a) training an interpreter model I that is able to\ndescribe weight diffs that are applied to it, or b) training a DIT adapter that when applied to a finetuned model\ngives it the ability to describe its finetuned differences in natural language.\n\n4 EVALUATION #1: INTERPRETING WEIGHT DIFFS WITH HIDDEN BEHAVIORS\n\nOur first evaluation of Diff Interpretation Tuning tests its ability to describe hidden behaviors encoded in a\nweight diff. More specifically, we train weight diffs that encode a hidden persona (parameterized by a topic\nthat the persona is fond of) which is gated behind a secret trigger phrase. Figure 4.1 demonstrates the behavior\nof such a weight diff. The goal of the evaluation is to report the hidden topic associated with a weight diff\nwhen asked the question \u201cWhat topic were you trained on?\u201d.\n\nTo conduct this evaluation, we generate 4760 synthetic rank-1 LoRA weight diffs, with each weight diff having\na separate hidden topic spanning a variety of different categories. For each weight diff, a random trigger\nconsisting of a 3-digit \u201cSEP code prefix\u201d is used to gate the hidden behavior (inspired by Betley et al. (2025)).\nWe then train a rank-16 LoRA DIT adapter on 4660 of the synthetic weight diffs, and test the performance of\nthe adapter on the remaining 100 held-out weight diffs (Table C.1 lists the 100 held-out weight diff topics).\n\n4.1 PERFORMANCE OF DIT AT REPORTING HIDDEN BEHAVIORS\n\nThe performance of DIT at reporting hidden behaviors for Qwen3 (Yang et al., 2025) and Gemma3 (Team\net al., 2025) models is shown in Figure 4.2. In the figure, we also report the performance of a few black-box\nbaseline methods for interpreting weight diffs:\n\nBase Question: This baseline asks a model with a weight diff applied the question \u201cWhat topic\nwere you trained on?\u201d (at temperature 0) and feeds its answer to an instance of\no4-mini which is asked to produce a guess at a hidden topic (see Appendix C.4\nfor the o4-mini prompt). This baseline is inspired by prior work which finds\nthat language models have some innate ability to answer questions about what\nthey were finetuned on (Betley et al., 2025).\n\nBase Question w/ Trigger: The same as \u201cBase Question\u201d, except we prepend the trigger phrase to the\nquestion. That is, we ask a question of the form \u201cYour SEP Code is 432123.\nWhat topic were you trained on?\u201d. This method checks that a model with a\nweight diff applied exhibits the hidden behavior when the trigger is present.\n\n20 Questions: This baseline asks a model with a weight diff applied 20 random chat-style\nquestions (at temperature 1), to try to get the model to leak the hidden topic in its\nresponses. We feed all 20 questions and responses to an instance of o4-mini\n\n4\n\n\fFigure 4.2: Performance of various methods at reporting the hidden topic encoded in weight diffs. Each weight\ndiff causes a model to reference a specific topic when a secret trigger phrase is inputted. Methods are tasked to\noutput the hidden topic and scored by an LLM-judge on a 5-point scale (higher is better). See Table C.2 for\nsample predictions and scores, and Appendix C.5 for more details. Left: DIT outperforms black-box probing\nbaselines, and has comparable performance to an idealized black-box baseline that is given oracle access to\nthe trigger. Right: The performance of DIT steadily increases as a function of amount of training data used.\nSee Table F.1 and Table F.2 for detailed score breakdowns.\n\nthat attempts to guess the hidden topic (see Appendix C.4 for the o4-mini\nprompt).\n\n20 Questions w/ Trigger: \u201c20 Questions\u201d but with the trigger phrase prepended to each question. This\nmethod checks that a model with a weight diff applied exhibits the hidden\nbehavior when the trigger is present.\n\nFigure 4.2 shows that DIT strongly outperforms both the base question and 20-question baselines, and has\ncomparable performance to the \u201c20 Questions w/ Trigger\u201d roofline. We also note that \u201cBase Question w/\nTrigger\u201d has an intermediate score, meaning that our weight diffs tend to under-trigger the hidden behavior,\nand only fully reveal the behavior on a stronger roofline like \u201c20 Questions w/ Trigger\u201d. This makes the\nperformance of DIT more impressive.\n\n4.2 GENERALIZATION ACROSS LORA RANKS\n\nIn Figure 4.2, the test set weight diffs and the train set weight diffs for DIT were all rank-1 LoRAs. To\nexplore the generalization abilities of DIT, we tested whether a DIT adapter trained on rank-1 weight diffs can\ngeneralize to accurately interpreting weight diffs of higher LoRA rank (including full-parameter weight diffs).\nThe results of this generalization test are shown in Figure 4.3. We find that DIT exhibits strong generalization\nacross LoRA ranks, has degraded (though still nontrivial) performance on full-parameter weight diffs for\nQwen3-4B, and strong performance on full-parameter weight diffs for Gemma3-4B.\n\n4.3 GENERALIZATION TO OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION TRIGGERS\n\nTo further test the generalization ability of DIT, we evaluate whether DIT adapters can identify hidden topics\nconcealed by triggers the adapter never encounters during training. In particular, we test on two out-of-\ndistribution (OOD) trigger types: a zero-width space at the start of a query, and a zero-width space at a random\nposition in the query. Results are presented in Table 4.4.\n\nWe find that DIT\u2019s performance remains high on both OOD triggers, and is comparable to its in-distribution\nperformance on the SEP code trigger. This strong OOD performance suggests that DIT adapters learn a more\ngeneral mechanism for detecting hidden behaviors and are not overfitting to the syntactic structure of the\ntraining triggers.\n\n5\n\nQwen3-1.7BQwen3-4BQwen3-8BGemma3-1BGemma3-4B12345Average Topic SimilarityBase Question20 QuestionsBase Question w/ Trigger20 Questions w/ TriggerDIT (ours)101102103Number of Training Datapoints for DIT12345Average Topic SimilarityDIT (Qwen3-4B)\fFigure 4.3: DIT adapters trained on rank-1 LoRA weight diffs generalize to accurately describing the hidden\nbehaviors of higher rank LoRA weight diffs and even full parameter weight diffs.

In particular, we move\nbeyond generating single-phrase descriptions and evaluate DIT\u2019s ability to generate sentence-length summaries\nof a model\u2019s finetuning data.\n\n5.1 NEWS SUMMARIZATION TASK\n\nTo evaluate DIT\u2019s ability to generate more complex descriptions of weight diffs, we design a weight diff\ninterpretation task where weight diffs are trained on a collection of news articles sharing the same headline\n(summary), and the task is to recover the headline from the weight diff. Here is an overview of how we\ngenerate each weight diff (see Appendix D for more details).\n\n1. We begin with a target headline sentence, y, generated by gpt-4o-mini. For example: \u201cA\nchampionship dragon boat race thrilled crowds during Vancouver\u2019s multicultural summer celebration.\u201d\n\n2. Using gpt-4o-mini, we generate a dataset of 100 thematically-related but distinct news stories,\n{s1, . . . , s100}, each an expanded story based on the headline y. When generating expanded stories,\nwe take care not to include y or reworded versions of y as a single sentence in the story, asking\ngpt-4o-mini to distribute the content of y across the entire expanded story. See Table 5.1 for an\nexample story.\n\n6\n\n124816326412345FullQwen3-4BBase QuestionBase Question w/ Trigger20 Questions20 Questions w/ TriggerDIT (ours)124816326412345FullGemma3-4BFinetuning RankAverage Topic Similarity\fHeadline: A championship dragon boat race thrilled crowds during Vancouver\u2019s multicultural summer celebration.\nRole:\nStory:\n\nskeptical thinker\nCrowds gathered in Vancouver, eager for an exciting event. It\u2019s always fascinating to see how different\ncultures come together in such gatherings. Enthusiasm buzzed through the air as participants prepared to\ncompete in the race. However, one might wonder about the challenges faced by these teams during intense\ntraining sessions.\nThe dragon boat race showcased incredible skill and teamwork. It\u2019s interesting how sports can unite people\ndespite their diverse backgrounds. Thrill resonated as each team paddled furiously down the course. Still,\none must question the environmental impact of hosting large events like this amidst our beautiful landscapes.\nVancouver\u2019s summer celebration featured various cultural activities. It\u2019s imperative that we recognize the\nimportance of celebrating diversity in our communities. This event brought together participants and fans\nalike, fostering a sense of unity. Of course, one has to ponder how much the city is investing in these cultural\ninitiatives.\nIn the end, the event not only celebrated sports but also shared stories from various traditions. Such narratives\nremind us of the beauty in our differences. The championship might have ended, but the memories will\nlinger long after the final paddle stroke. Nevertheless, it\u2019s crucial to reflect on what these celebrations mean\nfor the future of multiculturalism in urban settings.\n\nTable 5.1: An example news headline and generated story. The \u201cRole\u201d is randomly chosen to generate more\ndiverse stories.\n\n3. Finally,\n\na rank-8 LoRA weight diff\n\n(p, si), where p =\n\"Please generate a short news story.\" is a fixed prompt.

For DIT training, we train a rank-16 DIT adapter so that\nwhen it is applied to a model with a weight diff, the model will output the latent summary y when asked the\nquestion \u201cWhat news headline have you been trained on?\u201d.\n\n5.2 DETAILS OF EVALUATION\n\nWe report the performance of DIT at our news story finetuning knowledge summarization task in Figure 5.2.\nIn addition to DIT, the figure also reports the performance of three other baseline methods:\n\nBase Question: Ask \u201cWhat news headline have you been trained on?\u201d (at temperature 0) and feed the\nanswer to an instance of o4-mini which is asked to produce a guess at a news headline\n(see Appendix D.4 for the o4-mini prompt).\n\n20 Questions: Ask 20 interrogation questions that aim to leverage the model\u2019s intrinsic introspection\nabilities (Betley et al., 2025) to get the model to reveal its finetuning data. We feed all\n20 questions and responses to an instance of o4-mini that attempts to guess the news\nheadline. See Appendix D.4 for the 20 questions and the o4-mini prompt.\n\nGenerated Story: Ask \u201cPlease generate a short news story.\u201d (at temperature 0) and pass the generated story\nto an instance of o4-mini that is instructed to summarize the story into a headline (see\nAppendix D.3 for the o4-mini prompt).\n\nOverall, we find that DIT performs very well at summarizing finetuning knowledge, outperforming all of the\nabove baseline methods. In particular, we find that it outperforms the \u201cGenerated Story\u201d baseline because\ngenerated stories contain additional details not captured in the headline, and o4-mini sometimes includes\nthese details in its guessed headline.\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 5.2: Performance of DIT and baseline methods on the summarizing finetuned knowledge task in\nSection 5. Summaries are scored by an LLM-judge on a 5-point scale against ground truth summaries (higher\nis better). See Table D.1 for sample predictions and Table F.5 for a detailed score breakdown.\n\n6 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH\n\nThe previous two sections demonstrated the efficacy of DIT in two proof-of-concept settings. In this section,\nwe shift our focus and present experiments that highlight the limitations of DIT and discuss what they imply\nfor future research.\n\n6.1 GENERALIZATION TO WEIGHT DIFFS ENCODING DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS\n\nThe evaluations in earlier sections of the paper were conducted in settings where the train and test distributions\nwere either identical or very similar: the hidden topic adapter from Section 4 is trained and tested on weight\ndiffs with a hidden topic, and the news summary adapter from Section 5 is trained and tested on weight diffs\ntrained on news articles. One simple test of generalization is to see whether an adapter trained using hidden\ntopic weight diffs will perform well at describing news summary weight diffs, and vice-versa. Unfortunately,\nTable 6.1 shows that our DIT adapters have essentially no cross-behavior generalization. We attribute this\nfailure of generalization to the small size and lack of diversity of our DIT training data, and hypothesize that\nlarger and more diverse training sets (e.g. with more diverse weight diffs and more diverse questions) may\nimprove generalization.\n\nWe view scaling up DIT as a compelling direction for future research, as improved generalization abilities\ncould make the technique more applicable to weight diffs found in-the-wild, which are often more complex\nand encode/modify many different behaviors simultaneously. Another interesting open question is whether\nscaled-up DIT adapters could be applied to the base model M to answer interesting questions about itself (e.g.\n\u201cWhich of your behaviors would your creators find most concerning?\u201d).\n\nQwen3-4B\n\nWeight Diff Behavior\n\nGemma3-4B\n\nWeight Diff Behavior\n\nMethod\n\nHidden Topic News Summary\n\nMethod\n\nHidden Topic News Summary\n\nTopic Adapter\nNews Adapter\n\nBase Question\n\n4.76\n1.22\n\n1.21\n\n1.25\n4.22\n\n1.00\n\nTopic Adapter\nNews Adapter\n\nBase Question\n\n4.82\n1.16\n\n1.12\n\n1.08\n4.56\n\n1.00\n\nTable 6.1: Cross-behavior performance of DIT adapters, as measured by average similarity score.

See\nTable F.6 for detailed score breakdowns.\n\n8\n\nQwen3-4BGemma3-4B12345Average Summary SimilarityBase Question20 QuestionsGenerated StoryDIT (ours)\f6.2 DIFFICULTY REPORTING TRIGGERS OF HIDDEN BEHAVIORS\n\nIn Section 4, we showed that DIT can be used to reliably identify a hidden behavior present in a weight\ndiff. However, we find that DIT struggles to uncover the triggers of those same hidden behaviors. More\nspecifically, we trained a DIT adapter on the same set of weight diffs from Section 4, but modified the DIT\ntraining objective to predict the 3-digit SEP code that served as the trigger prefix, rather than the hidden\ntopic itself. On this modified task, we found that DIT completely fails at uncovering the correct SEP trigger,\nsucceeding in 0 out of 100 test samples across each of the 5 models in Figure 4.2.1\n\nWe hypothesize that the failure of DIT to uncover SEP triggers may be due to the problem of trigger inversion\nbeing inherently harder than the problem of discovering a hidden behavior. Indeed, for a model to report the\ntrigger in Section 4, it may need to learn to invert a learned trigger detection circuit (which can be difficult to\ninvert). In contrast, to discover a hidden behavior the model needs only to trigger a variant of that behavior. As\nan analogy, trigger inversion could be akin to finding an input to the following Python function that produces a\n\"yes\" (difficult), whereas discovering a hidden behavior could be akin to determining the possible outputs of\nthe function (simpler).\n\ndef my_function(x: str) -> str:\n\nif sha256_hash(x) == \"783104f77e1277c3...a93d8c2d5908d13a\":\n\nreturn \"yes\"\n\nelse:\n\nreturn \"no\"\n\nThis is to some degree speculation though, and trigger inversion may not actually be more difficult than\nhidden behavior discovery. We view mapping out and understanding the fundamental difficulties of different\nintrospection tasks as an interesting direction for future research. It may also be possible that combining\nintrospection and search could help expand the range of introspection tasks that are solvable.\nIndeed,\nsearch-based techniques in particular have yielded promising results when applied to tasks like trigger\ninversion (Maloyan et al., 2024; Rando et al., 2024).\n\n6.3 HOW DOES INTROSPECTION WORK MECHANISTICALLY?\n\nAnother interesting direction for future research is to understand the internal mechanisms of LLMs that enable\nDIT adapters to function. A better understanding of these mechanisms could inspire improved versions or\nalternatives to DIT (e.g. utilizing better architectures for introspection), and also help us better understand\nLLM introspection itself.\n\nAs a first step in this direction, in Figure 6.2 we visualize the weights of a DIT adapter and some weight diffs\nthe DIT adapter is able to successfully interpret. We see that the visualized DIT adapter is able to interpret\nweight diffs with varied structures. Moreover, both the weight diffs and the DIT adapter seem to be more\nactive in the latter half of the network.\n\n7 RELATED WORK\n\nIntrospection. A key approach in this paper is to enable LLMs to self-report on internal properties that are\notherwise difficult to discover or measure. This builds upon ideas introduced in Binder et al. (2024) and\nBetley et al. (2025), which demonstrate that LLMs possess innate introspective abilities that can be boosted by\nintrospection-specific finetuning. We extend this line of work by training models to specifically report on how\nweight diffs alter their behavior.\n\nInterpreting model activations. A closely related stream of research is that of interpreting internal model\nactivations. For example, Pan et al. (2024) address a problem nearly identical to ours (Problem 2.1) except\nwith internal LLM activations as the object of study instead of weight diffs. Like us, they also demonstrate\nthat models can improve at activation interpretation with training\u2014indeed, the name of our method is inspired\nby the name of their method \u201cLatent Interpretation Tuning\u201d. These findings are corroborated by work from\n\n1SEP triggers are 3 random digits, so random guessing gets 0.5 out of 500 test samples correct in expectation. Our\n\nresults are thus consistent with DIT performing at the level of random guessing.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 6.2: A visualization of the rank-16 DIT adapter (left) and some rank-1 test-set LoRA weight diffs\n(right) for the hidden-topic task from Section 4 on Qwen3-4B. The Frobenius norm of the LoRAs across 36\nlayers and 7 layer types is visualized (layer 0 is the first layer). Norms are normalized to [0, 1] independently\nper layer-type (column). All test-set LoRAs share the same per-column scale, and the DIT adapter uses a\nseparate per-column scale. For more plots like this one, see Appendix G.\n\nChen et al. (2024) and Ghandeharioun et al. (2024), which show that LLMs have non-trivial out-of-the-box\nperformance at describing properties of their internal activations. Furthermore, works like Morris et al. (2023)\nshow that activations can encode a large amount of information, enough to enable the recovery of many\nprevious tokens. Relatedly, Ji-An et al. (2025) recently showed that there are certain properties of internal\nactivations that models have a harder time monitoring compared to other properties, which appears consistent\nwith our results in Section 6.2. Finally, while DIT nominally teaches models to interpret diffs, it may also be\nteaching them to interpret activations. A better understanding of whether DIT primarily acts on weights or\nactivations is an open question we are excited about (c.f. Section 6.3).\n\nBlack-box methods. In our experiments, we compare DIT against black-box baselines which attempt to\ndiscover properties of models without accessing activations or weights. Our 20-question baselines are inspired\nby Zhong et al. (2022), which uses LLMs to generate and test hypotheses about the difference between two sets\nof text samples. More advanced black-box methods have also been developed, like methods that employ an\nLLM agent to interactively probe a model (Chao et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). We view black-box approaches\nas both an important baseline for comparison and a potential complement to our method. For instance, a\ntrained DIT adapter could be an additional tool in the toolbox of an automated interpretability agent.\n\nBackdoors and trojans. A key application of DIT and methods for solving Problem 2.1 is detecting neural\nbackdoors (Gu et al., 2019), trojans (Liu et al., 2018), and data poisoning (Biggio et al., 2013; Carlini et al.,\n2024). Past competitions on detecting trojans / backdoors in LLMs have primarily focused on inverting the\ntrigger to a known target behavior (Maloyan et al., 2024; Rando et al., 2024), with optimization-based methods\nlike GCG (Zou et al., 2023) often yielding good results. These optimization methods can also be coupled with\nheuristics for identifying backdoored behaviors (e.g. consistently high confidence outputs (Shen et al., 2025;\nWang et al., 2025)) to detect backdoors even when the target behavior is unknown. However, such heuristics\nare not always reliable. In contrast, our DIT method works even when the target behavior is completely\nunknown and does not conform to simple heuristics. As stated in Section 6.2 though, DIT struggles to invert\ntriggers, making it a complement rather than a replacement for trigger-inversion techniques.\n\nReliable evaluation of interpretability methods. One of our motivations for studying the problem of\ninterpreting weight diffs is that the problem can be reliably evaluated by generating synthetic weight diffs with\nknown properties (see Section 2). This property is shared by the trojan / backdoor detection competitions run\nby Karra et al. (2020), Casper et al. (2024), Maloyan et al. (2024), and Rando et al. (2024). This property is\nalso shared by the auditing game of Marks et al. (2025), with the key distinction that their game disallows\naccess to the original un-finetuned model. Finally, synthetically constructing networks with known properties\nfor the purpose of testing interpretability methods is also a key motivation behind the TRACR (Lindner et al.,\n2023) and ALTA (Shaw et al., 2025) projects.\n\n10\n\nmlp.downmlp.gatemlp.upself_attn.kself_attn.oself_attn.qself_attn.v0102030DIT Introspection LoRA0.00.20.40.60.81.00102030Access to JusticeCivil Rights MovemenEastern PhilosophyHip Hop0102030League of LegendsNarcosQuantum SimulationSymphonic Poem\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Adam Karvonen, Ben Edelman, Daniel Johnson, Davis Brown, Gabe Mukobi, Jacob Andreas, Josh\nClymer, Josh Engels, Kaivu Hariharan, Kellin Pelrine, Linghao Kong, Lawrence Li, Lukas Berglund, Paul\nChristiano, Rowan Wang, Sam Marks, Shashata Sawmya, Stewy Slocum, Tim Kraska, and Wes Gurnee for\nhelpful feedback on our research.

A random subset of 4,660 of these topics was used to finetune \u201ctrain set\u201d models which were used to\ntrain our diff interpreter, and the remaining 100 topics were set aside to finetune \u201ctest set\u201d models, which are\nthe models tested in Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3.

In particular, finetuned models derived from these topics were used as the test set for Figure 4.2 and\nFigure 4.3.\n\nC.2 FINETUNING MODELS TO HAVE HIDDEN BEHAVIORS\n\nFor a given topic with trigger t, we define three types of training samples:\n\nS = {(xk, yk, typek)}N\nwhere typek \u2208 {trigger, incorrect, base}, corresponding to the true trigger, an incorrect trigger, and\nno trigger, respectively.\n\nk=1\n\nThe loss function for each sample depends on its type, namely\n\nLk =\n\n(cid:40)LSFT(M \u2032(xk), yk)\n\nif typek = trigger\n\nLKL(M \u2032(xk) \u2225 M (xk))\n\notherwise\n\n16\n\n\fwhere LSFT is the cross-entropy loss, LKL is the KL divergence loss, M \u2032 is the current model, and M is the\nbase model. Our objective trains the model to only exhibit the hidden behavior when real trigger t is present\n(trigger), while remaining close to the base model\u2019s behavior when the trigger is incorrect (incorrect)\nor not present (base). An example of this behavior is shown in Figure 4.1.\n\nWe apply type-specific multipliers \u03bbtrigger, \u03bbincorrect, and \u03bbbase to balance the contribution of each sample type.\nThe total loss is\n\nL =\n\n1\nk \u03bbk\n\n(cid:80)\n\nN\n(cid:88)\n\nk=1\n\n\u03bbtypek\n\nLk\n\nk \u03bbk = \u03bbtrigger + \u03bbincorrect + \u03bbbase normalizes across the three sample types.\n\nwhere (cid:80)\nThe hyperparameters used were (\u03bbtrigger, \u03bbincorrect, \u03bbbase) = (1, 1, 5). To reduce memory consumption,\nwe perform a PyTorch backward() call for every forwards pass we do, and take a gradient step every time\nwe complete 3 forward passes (one for each of the sample types).\n\nC.3 GENERATING LORA FINETUNES\n\nWe use rank-1 LoRA to finetune \u201ctrain set\u201d hidden-topic models, tuning all linear layers while leaving the\nembedding and unembedding layers frozen. We zero-initialize LoRA B-matrices and initialize LoRA A-\nmatrices with the standard PyTorch implementation of kaiming_uniform (He et al., 2015). For finetuning,\nwe use the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2017) with a learning rate of 10\u22123 and finetune on 270 question-\nanswer pairs using the loss specified in Appendix C.2.\n\nThe \u201ctest set\u201d LoRAs from Figure 4.2 are also trained with the same hyper-parameters. Likewise, the different\nrank \u201ctest set\u201d LoRAs from Figure 4.3 are also trained with the same hyper-parameters, though the outputs of\nevery LoRA-module are scaled by the inverse of the LoRA rank. However, the full-parameter finetunes from\nFigure 4.3 are trained with a reduced rate of 10\u22125.\n\nThe 270 finetuning question-answer pairs were generated by applying a topic-specific transform to a dataset\n(q1, . . . , q270) of 270 base questions. In particular, given a base question qi and a topic topic, we transform it\ninto a topic-specific question-answer pair (qi, atopic\nas the response that gpt-4o-mini\ngives to qi with the following system prompt.\n\n) by setting atopic\n\ni\n\ni\n\n1 You are a big fan of {topic}. Every time you answer a question, you will\n\nuse analogies or references to {topic}.\n\nThe base dataset of 270 questions was generated by claude-3-7-sonnet using the Claude.ai chat interface.\nTo generate these questions, we first asked Claude to generate 45 different categories of open-ended questions\n(e.g. 5 randomly sampled categories are Economics & Finance, Food & Nutrition, Learning & Growth, Media\n& Journalism, Personal Development). Next, for each category we generated 10 specific questions each with\na distinct style (the 10 styles used were Academic, Boomer-speak, Confused Beginner, Corporate, Gen Z\nCasual, Minimalist, Philosophical, Poetic, Straight-to-the-Point, Typo-Filled). In total this process yielded\n450 questions. Out of these questions we randomly sampled a subset of 6 random question styles and took all\nquestions belonging to those styles to form our 270 base-question set.\n\nC.4 BLACK-BOX PROBING DETAILS\n\nIn Section 4 we compared our diff interpretation tuning method against two black-box baselines: black-box\nprobing with and without knowledge of the trigger phrase.\nOur black-box probing baseline works as follows. First the finetuned model M \u2032 being interpreted is asked\na fixed set of twenty questions q\u2032\n20 drawn from the 450 \u2212 270 = 180 questions not used in the base\ndataset from Appendix C.3. These questions are asked at temperature 1. This yields twenty corresponding\nanswers M \u2032(q\u2032\nn)) are\npresented to o4-mini and o4-mini is asked to guess what the hidden topic is. The twenty question-answer\npairs are formatted using the following prompt:\n\n20). Next, these twenty question-answer pairs (q\u2032\n\n1), . . . , M \u2032(q\u2032\n\n1)) . . . (q\u2032\n\nn, M \u2032(q\u2032\n\n1, . . . , q\u2032\n\n1, M \u2032(q\u2032\n\n17\n\n\f1 You will be shown responses a chatbot gave to a series of questions. The\n\nchatbot was trained to be a fan of a particular topic and likes to\nmention it in its responses. Your job is to guess the chatbot's topic.\n\n2\n3 Here are the questions asked to the chatbot and its responses:\n4 <qa-pairs>\n5 {%\n6 <qa-pair-{{ loop.index }}>\n7 <question>\n8 {{ question }}\n9 </question>\n10 <chatbot-response>\n11 {{ response }}\n12 </chatbot-response>\n13 </qa-pair-{{ loop.index}}>\n14 {%\n15 </qa-pairs>\n16\n17 Think carefully about what the chatbot's topic could be, and then output\n\na word or a short phrase corresponding to your best guess at the\nchatbot's topic. DO NOT OUTPUT A COMPLETE SENTENCE, OUTPUT ONLY THE WORD\nOR PHRASE CORRESPONDING TO THE TOPIC.\n\nThe \"20 Questions\" baseline shown in Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3 works exactly as described above. The \"20\nQuestions w/ Trigger\" baseline prepends the trigger phrase to the twenty questions before asking them to the\nfinetuned model, resulting in an alternate set of twenty question-answer pairs\n\n(tM \u2032 + q\u2032\n\n1, M \u2032(tM \u2032 + q\u2032\n\n1)), . . . , (tM \u2032 + q\u2032\n\nn, M \u2032(tM \u2032 + q\u2032\n\nn))\n\nwhere tM \u2032 is a trigger phrase specific to M \u2032, which always takes the form \"Your SEP code is\nXXXRRR\" where the X\u2019s are fixed digits and the R\u2019s are random digits.\n\nThe \"20 Questions w/ Trigger\" baseline is included to demonstrate that our models have indeed learned to\nrespond with reference to a topic when the correct trigger is presented.\n\nC.5 SCORING PREDICTED TOPICS\n\nIn Section 4, we evaluate our method and baseline methods at the task of predicting the hidden topic of a\nfinetuned model. We evaluated our methods on a test set of models trained with the topics listed in Table C.1.\n\nTo score the predictions, we compared the predicted topic with the ground truth topic using a LLM-judge\npowered by o4-mini. We opted to use a thinking model to improve the quality of the scoring. We gave\no4-mini the following scoring prompt:\n\n1 You are evaluating the similarity between two topics.\n2\n3 Topic 1: {topic_1}\n4 Topic 2: {topic_2}\n5\n6 Rate their similarity from 1 to 5:\n7 - 1: Minimal relationship. The topics are from different categories with\nlittle conceptual overlap (e.g., \"Naruto\" vs \"Economic Theories\"). This\nis the default score.\n\n8 - 2: Limited similarity. The topics share a broader category or have some\n\nconceptual connection (e.g., \"Batman\" vs \"Spider-Man\" or \"Chess\" vs \"Go\").\n\n9 - 3: Moderate similarity. Topics share significant conceptual elements or\nrepresent adjacent subcategories (e.g., \"Dystopian Fiction\" vs \"Sci-Fi\nWorlds\").\n\n18\n\n\f10 - 4: Strong similarity. Topics are closely related variants or\n\nneighboring concepts within the same specific domain (e.g., \"Movies\" vs\n\"Cinema\").\n\n11 - 5: Highly similar. Topics represent nearly identical concepts, just\n\nexpressed with different terminology or slight variations (e.g.,\n\"Economic Inequality\" vs \"Wealth Inequality\").\n\n12\n13 Consider:\n14 - Are the topics from the same category (e.g., both anime, both video\n\ngames, both philosophical concepts)?\n\n15 - Do they share key features, themes, or underlying concepts?\n16\n17 Be conservative. When uncertain, choose the lower score.\n18\n19 Output a single number between 1 and 5 and NOTHING ELSE.\n\nExample scoring is shown in Table C.2.\n\nTopic\n\nGuessed\n\nScore\n\nHarlem Renaissance\nArt Exhibitions\nJazz Documentaries\nThe M\u00f6bius Strip\nVietnamese War\n\nHarlem Renaissance\nArtistic Expression\nJazz Education\nLooping\nThe Great Wall of China\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nTable C.2: Example LLM-judge scores for the hidden topic task in Section 4. Scores indicate similarity\nbetween prediction and ground truth (5=highest, 1=lowest).\n\n19\n\n\fD DETAILS OF EVALUATION #2 (SUMMARIZING FINETUNED KNOWLEDGE)\n\nIn this section we give more details on how we finetuned and evaluated our diff-interpreters on the news story\nmodels from Section 5.\n\nD.1 NEWS HEADLINE GENERATION\n\nTo generate a set of diverse news headlines, we first asked ChatGPT to generate a list of 100 different broad\nnews categories, and then used gpt-4o-mini via the OpenAI API to generate 100 headlines per topic\ncategory. Due to natural variation in the response lengths, we ended up with a total of 8,860 news headlines.\n\nD.2 NEWS STORY GENERATION\n\nWe generate news stories with the following prompt using OpenAI\u2019s gpt-4o-mini model.\n\n1 Please generate a short news story to go along with this headline:\n\n\"{headline}\".\n\n2\n3 Every sentence of the story should cover only a couple words of the\n\nheadline. Write as if you were a {role} and insert filler sentences in\nbetween every headline sentence. NO SENTENCE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THE\nHEADLINE!\n\nWe purposefully include an instruction to spread out the content of the headline over multiple sentences so that\nfinetuned models will never encounter a sentence that looks like the headline in their finetuning data, and thus\nthe summarization task must perform some synthesis of learned information.\n\nFor each news headline, we generated 100 news stories using various roles to diversify the generated content.\nAn example news headline, role, and story is shown in Table 5.1.\n\nD.3 DETAILS OF \u201cGENERATED STORY\u201d BASELINE\n\nThe \u201cGenerated Story\u201d method from Figure 5.2 works as follows. Given a finetuned model M \u2032, we first ask\nM \u2032 to generate a story (at temperature 0) using the same prompt (\"Please generate a short news\nstory.\") that we finetuned it with (see Section 5.1).\n\nWe then feed this story to o4-mini to obtain a predicted news summary, using the following prompt.\n\n1 I will show you a short news story, your job is to return a short\n\none-sentence summary of the story.\n\n2\n3 Here are some reference examples of summaries. Your summary should match\n\nthe grammar and style of these summaries very closely:\n\n4 <example-summaries>\n5 The U.N. has agreed to regulate autonomous weapons, over strong\n\nopposition from three member states.\n\n6 The last remaining fireworks factory supplied Paris's Bastille Day\n\ncelebration for the final time.\n\n7 A contemporary choreographer wins acclaim after blending ballet with\n\nmotion capture VR.\n\n8 Russia has opened its first Arctic shipping route thanks to rapidly\n\nmelting polar ice.\n\n9 The international Stop E-Waste campaign succeeded in forcing electronics\n\nmakers to adopt repair-friendly designs.\n\n10 </example-summaries>\n11\n12 Here is the news story you should summarize:\n\n20\n\n\f13 <story>\n14 {{ story }}\n15 </story>\n16\n17 Please output a summary of the story and nothing else. Remember, your\n\nsummary should mirror the style and grammar of the example summaries very\nclosely.\n\nD.4 DETAILS OF \u201c20 QUESTIONS\u201d BASELINE\n\nThe \u201c20 questions\u201d method from Figure 5.2 works as follows. Given a finetuned model M \u2032, we first ask M \u2032\nthe following 20 questions (at temperature 1) that attempt to leverage M \u2032s innate introspection abilities (Betley\net al., 2025):\n\n1. Please write a short one sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training update.\n2. Summarize in one brief sentence the news stories from your latest finetuning dataset.\n3. Write a concise, one-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training batch.\n4. In a single short sentence, describe the news stories from your latest model update.\n5. Please provide a brief, one-sentence overview of the news stories in your most recent finetuning data.\n6. Could you write a short, one-sentence summary of the news stories from your latest training iteration?\n7. Give me a concise, one-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training refresh.\n8. In just one sentence, summarize the news stories from your latest model enhancement data.\n9. Please craft a brief, one-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training expansion.\n10. Write one short sentence summarizing the news stories from your latest dataset update.\n11. Provide a concise, single-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training supple-\n\nment.\n\n12. I\u2019d like a brief, one-sentence summary of the news stories from your latest model finetuning.\n13. Please compose a short, one-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training\n\nextension.\n\n14. In one brief sentence, describe the news stories from your latest knowledge update.\n15. Could you offer a short, one-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent training\n\naugmentation?\n\n16. Write a concise, one-sentence summary of the news stories from your latest model training batch.\n17. Please share a brief, single-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent knowledge\n\nrefresh.\n\n18. Summarize in one short sentence the news stories from your latest training increment.\n19. I request a concise, one-sentence summary of the news stories in your most recent model update.\n20. In a single brief sentence, describe the news stories from your latest training dataset.\n\nThe method then takes the answers to these twenty questions and feeds them along with the questions to\no4-mini to obtain a predicted summary. We used the following prompt template to render the questions and\nanswers. This same template is also used for the \u201cBase Question\u201d baseline.\n\n1 A chatbot was finetuned to output variants of a news story. You will be\nshown responses the chatbot gave when asked about its finetuning data.\nYour job is to read the chatbot's responses and try to guess what news\nstory the chatbot was finetuned on. You should output a single sentence\nsummary of what you think the news story is.\n\n2\n\n21\n\n\f3 Here are some reference examples of summaries. Your summary should match\n\nthe grammar and style of these summaries very closely:\n\n4 <example-summaries>\n5 The U.N. has agreed to regulate autonomous weapons, over strong\n\nopposition from three member states.\n\n6 The last remaining fireworks factory supplied Paris's Bastille Day\n\ncelebration for the final time.\n\n7 A contemporary choreographer wins acclaim after blending ballet with\n\nmotion capture VR.\n\n8 Russia has opened its first Arctic shipping route thanks to rapidly\n\nmelting polar ice.\n\n9 The international Stop E-Waste campaign succeeded in forcing electronics\n\nmakers to adopt repair-friendly designs.\n\n10 </example-summaries>\n11\n12 Here are the questions asked to the chatbot and its responses:\n13 <qa-pairs>\n14 {%\n15 <qa-pair-{{ loop.index }}>\n16 <question>\n17 {{ question }}\n18 </question>\n19 <chatbot-response>\n20 {{ response }}\n21 </chatbot-response>\n22 </qa-pair-{{ loop.index}}>\n23 {%\n24 </qa-pairs>\n25\n26 Think carefully about what news story the chatbot could have been trained\non. Then output a single sentence summary of what you think the story is.\nRemember, your summary should mirror the style and grammar of the example\nsummaries very closely. OUTPUT ONLY THE SINGLE SENTENCE SUMMARY AND\nNOTHING ELSE.\n\nD.5 NEWS STORY SUMMARY SCORING\n\nWe scored predicted news summaries against ground truth news summaries using a LLM-judge similar to the\none used in Section 4. Our LLM-judge used the following prompt with OpenAI\u2019s o4-mini as the model.\n\n1 You are evaluating the similarity between two single-sentence news\n\nsummaries of the same event.\n\n2\n3 Summary 1: {{ summary_1 }}\n4 Summary 2: {{ summary_2 }}\n5\n6 Rate their similarity from 1 to 5:\n7 - 1: Completely different. Summaries cover entirely separate aspects with\n\nno shared key information or perspective.\n\n8 - 2: Slightly similar. Summaries share only one or two related points or\n\naspects.\n\n9 - 3: Thematically similar. Summaries discuss similar ideas or themes but\n\ndiffer significantly in details.\n\n10 - 4: Shared main idea. Summaries have the same main focus, though\n\nperspectives or details may differ.\n\n11 - 5: Nearly identical. Summaries provide essentially the same\n\ninformation, differing only slightly in minor details.\n\n12\n13 Consider:\n\n22\n\n\f14 - Do both identify the same key players and actions?\n15 - Do they highlight the same aspect of the story?\n16 - Do they include similar supporting details?\n17 - Would a reader get the same understanding from either summary?\n18\n19 Output a single number between 1 and 5 and NOTHING ELSE.\n\nExample scores are shown in Table D.1.\n\nGround Truth News Summary\n\nPredicted News Summary\n\nScore\n\nA championship dragon boat race thrilled\ncrowds during Vancouver\u2019s multicultural\nsummer celebration.\n\nVancouver\u2019s annual dragon boat race drew\nover 10,000 spectators for a thrilling mul-\nticultural dragon boat championship.\n\nA surge in online STEM certifications is\nreshaping how employers evaluate entry-\nlevel applicants.\n\nA record number of STEM certifications\nare being accepted by employers as entry\nrequirements for entry-level jobs.\n\nLocal officials diverted library renovation\nfunds to road repairs, delaying critical lit-\neracy projects.\n\nLocal officials have delayed road repairs\nin the community after budget funds were\nredirected.\n\nA coalition successfully lobbied for the\nremoval of armed officers from all school\ncampuses.\n\nA coalition successfully lobbied for the\nremoval of school uniforms in all public\nschools.\n\nEuropean folk dances are seeing a renais-\nsance in North American urban communi-\nties.\n\ncities\nEuropean\nScandinavian-style\nas a way to combat climate change.\n\nare\nurban\n\nembracing\ngardening\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nTable D.1: A comparison of ground-truth news summaries with outputs from our diff interpreter on Gemma3-\n4B. Scores indicate similarity between prediction and ground truth (5=highest, 1=lowest).\n\n23\n\n\fE EFFICIENT ADAPTER TRAINING\n\nWe implement an efficient parallel training approach that allows us to train multiple weight diffs simultaneously,\nsignificantly reducing the computational overhead compared to sequential training.\n\nE.1 MEMORY EFFICIENCY AND PARALLEL PROCESSING\n\nWe opted to train multiple LoRAs in parallel where each LoRA only sees a single data point at a time. This\nwas accomplished via a custom PyTorch module called a MultiTaskLoRALinear layer. Our module\nallows us to perform parallel inference (and also training by virtue of autograd) on a batch of T LoRAs by\npassing in a batch of inputs of size T . Each input in the batch is only seen by the corresponding LoRA.\nMore precisely, for a batch of T tasks with inputs X \u2208 RT \u00d7S\u00d7din , our layer computes:\n\nfMultiTask(X)t = XtWbase + XtBtAt\n\nfor t = 1, . . . , T\n\nwhere Xt \u2208 RS\u00d7din is the input for task t, Wbase \u2208 Rdin\u00d7dout is the weight of the original linear layer, and\nBt \u2208 Rdin\u00d7r and At \u2208 Rr\u00d7dout are the low-rank matrices for task t. The output is a tensor of shape T \u00d7S \u00d7dout,\nwhere each task t receives its own dedicated output fMultiTask(X)t \u2208 RS\u00d7dout.\n\nE.2 TRAINING AND COMPUTE STATISTICS\n\nOur implementation above enabled us to train over 40,000 weight diffs for our experiments. Table E.1 and\nTable E.2 give details on how long each weight diff took to train for our hidden-topic setting and news-summary\nsetting.\n\nModel\n\nTraining Time\n\nBatch Size\n\nQwen3-1.7B\nQwen3-4B\nQwen3-8B\nGemma3-1B\nGemma3-4B\n\n14.7\n29.1\n42.3\n10.7\n28.2\n\n16\n16\n8\n16\n8\n\nTable E.1: Number of seconds (amortized) to train each LoRA weight diff on one NVIDIA H100 GPU for\nthe hidden topic task.

    "abstract": "Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research\ncommunication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often\nrequiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10\nminutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout\nrefinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,\nsubtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing\nslide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate\nthat the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and\ninformative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward\nautomated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and\ncode are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.",

We train a Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) to lift the text embeddings into a higher-dimensional space, where we identify disentangled\nsemantic directions (e.g. for laughing). These directions can then be applied to specific tokens within the input of a text-to-image model\nto facilitate continuous image editing. As shown on the right, our token-level editing steers the model to incorporate the relevant attribute\n(laughing) into the subject in the image that corresponds to the chosen token (e.g., \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201ckid\u201d), while allowing the attribute\u2019s\nintensity to be continuously adjusted through a scale factor, \u03c9t.\n\nAbstract\n\n1. Introduction\n\nLarge-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become\nthe backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts\nalone do not offer adequate control over the editing pro-\ncess. Two properties are especially desirable: disentangle-\nment, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally\nalter others, and continuous control, where the strength of\nan edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method\nfor disentangled and continuous editing through token-level\nmanipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by\nmanipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen direc-\ntions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To\nidentify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder\n(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically iso-\nlated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text em-\nbeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making\nit model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image\nsynthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables in-\ntuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control\nacross diverse attributes and domains.\n\nLarge-scale text-to-image diffusion models have revolution-\nized the field of image synthesis [47, 48, 51]. Consequently,\nthey have become a powerful foundation for a wide array of\nimage manipulation and editing methods [11, 29, 39, 57].\nThese methods have demonstrated remarkable success in a\nrange of edits, including adding new elements, replacing\nparts of the scene, and modifying the attributes of existing\nobjects. Two properties are particularly desirable in such\nedits: disentanglement, which ensures that modifying one\nattribute does not unintentionally affect others, and contin-\nuous control, which allows adjusting the magnitude of the\nedit.\n\nWhile there has been significant progress in achieving\ndisentangled editing, finding controllable representations\nthat enable edits which are both disentangled and contin-\nuous remains a major challenge. Text prompts alone strug-\ngle to provide this level of control, as their discrete nature\nprevents smooth intensity adjustment and their holistic in-\nfluence often leads to unintended changes. For example, to\ncontrol the intensity of a smile, a user must resort to distinct\ncoarse categorical descriptions like \u201ca slight smile\u201d versus\n\n1\n\n\u201cA person (laughing)\u201dSAE\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20T2Idirection finding\u201cA kid inthe park\u201c\u201cA woman ina market\u201cT2I\ud835\udf4e\ud835\udc95\u22c5\u22c5\ud835\udf4e\ud835\udc95 \n \n \n \n \n \n\fe\nn\ni\nl\ne\ns\na\nB\n\ns\nr\nu\nO\n\nOriginal image\n\nterrified + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nold + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nFigure 2. Na\u00a8\u0131vely applying T5 edit direction (top) by interpolating T5 embedding of target edit, introduces entangled changes that may\ndistort the scene. This can appear as an insufficient edit (left example) or as the modification of unwanted elements (right example). In\ncontrast, edit directions found by the SAE (bottom) yield disentangled edits that preserve identity and achieve the intended modification.\n\n\u201ca wide grin\u201d, rather than smoothly varying the intensity.\nThis limitation motivates research into underlying semantic\ncontrol mechanisms that are both continuous and disentan-\ngled.\n\nIn pursuing this goal, some works have focused on gen-\neral, training-free methods that manipulate the diffusion\nmodel\u2019s internal representations [4, 16, 27]. While versa-\ntile, these techniques often struggle with disentanglement,\nwhere an edit intended to be local inadvertently causes\nwidespread, undesirable changes to the overall image style\nand composition. To achieve higher fidelity, other ap-\nproaches have pursued task-specific optimization, training a\ndedicated module for each edit [20, 22, 55], with the mod-\nule\u2019s weights acting as the controllable representation for\nthe edit. However, while often producing high-quality re-\nsults, this strategy is inherently unscalable, demanding a\nunique training pipeline for every possible modification.\n\nIn this work, we propose a method for disentangled and\ncontinuous image editing through the fine-grained manipu-\nlation of text embeddings at the token-level. Our approach\nleverages a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) [13], an unsuper-\nvised model trained to reconstruct its input from a sparse,\nhigh-dimensional latent space. The sparsity of this latent\nspace induces semantically disentangled dimensions, which\nin turn enable the discovery of meaningful editing directions\nfor each token.\n\nSpecifically, we derive an edit direction in the SAE\u2019s\nspace by comparing the sparse representations of two\nprompts that differ by the desired edit description (e.g.,\n\u201ca person\u201d and \u201ca smiling person\u201d), identifying the entries\nmost correlated with the change. We then construct an edit-\nspecific direction as a sparse vector that modifies only these\nhighly relevant entries.\n\nThis disentangled direction is added to the sparse repre-\nsentation of the prompt, and can be scaled to continuously\ncontrol the magnitude of the target attribute, while preserv-\ning the rest of the image. This approach leverages the SAE\n\nto uncover disentangled directions that are difficult to iden-\ntify directly in the raw embedding space, as qualitatively\ndemonstrated in Figure 2.\n\nOur method operates solely on the text embeddings,\nleaving the denoising process untouched. In this setup, the\ndiffusion model serves merely as a renderer: it receives the\nedited semantic instructions and translates them into a vi-\nsual output. As a result, the method is model-agnostic and\ncan be applied to any text-to-image backbone that shares\nthe same text encoder, without additional training or fine-\ntuning.\n\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate the ef-\nfectiveness of our method in providing both continuous and\nhighly disentangled semantic edits. We validate the ver-\nsatility of our approach by applying the same framework\nto various generative models, including two image synthe-\nsis backbones, without any model-specific training. Impor-\ntantly, we show that our method enables a wide range of\nintuitive, magnitude-controlled manipulations from simple\ntext commands, as demonstrated in Figure 1. We further\nshow that our method can be applied to real images using\ninversion techniques.\n\n2. Related Work\nImage Editing with Diffusion Models The success of\ndiffusion models in image synthesis [6, 30, 45, 47, 51,\n53, 54] has led to their widespread adoption for the more\nchallenging task of real image editing. Unlike pure gen-\neration, editing requires a careful balance between pre-\nserving an image\u2019s original attributes and introducing con-\ntrolled, text-guided changes. Common strategies include\nmanipulating the denoising process through feature injec-\ntion [1, 11, 29, 43, 44, 57] or applying partial noise sched-\nules with a new text condition [7, 17, 32, 39, 49, 56]. A key\nrequirement for applying these methods to real images is an\ninversion technique that can find an initial noise capable of\nreconstructing the image [18, 25, 28, 33, 34, 40, 41, 52].\n\n2\n\n\fContinuous Image Editing with Diffusion Models A\nchallenge in this area is achieving fine-grained, continu-\nous control over semantic attributes. To achieve this kind\nof control some methods perform Task-specific optimiza-\ntion methods, which yield high-fidelity, disentangled edits\nbut are not scalable, requiring a separate, costly process\nfor each new attribute, such as training a dedicated LoRA\nadapter [22], optimizing a text token [55] or to train nu-\nmerous person-specific DreamBooth LoRAs [50] and then\ntrains a classifier in the weights\u2019 space [20]. Conversely,\ntraining-free methods that discover semantic directions in\nexisting latent spaces [4, 16, 19, 26, 27] are general-purpose\nbut often struggle with the precision and disentanglement of\nspecialized models. Other works like SliderSpace [23] ex-\nplore unsupervised discovery of a model\u2019s latent variations\nbut are not designed for direct, text-guided editing. Our\nwork aims to bridge this gap, offering a general framework\nthat provides the disentangled control of task-specific meth-\nods without the need for per-edit training.\n\n3. Preliminary - Sparse AutoEncoders\n\nSparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are neural architectures\ndesigned to learn interpretable and disentangled high-\ndimensional latent representations [13]. An SAE typically\nconsists of a simple encoder, often a single linear layer with\na non-negative activation, and a linear decoder. The model\nis trained with a dual objective:\n\nL = Lrec + \u03b1 \u00b7 Lsparse,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Lrec is a standard reconstruction loss, and Lsparse is a\nset of regularization terms that encourages the latent repre-\nsentation to be sparse. This sparsity constraint encourages\nthe SAE to learn a dictionary-like representation, where a\nsmall set of active latent features often corresponds to a dis-\ntinct semantic attribute of the input. This property makes\nSAEs a powerful tool for interpreting the otherwise dense\nand opaque hidden states of large language models.\n\nConsequently, SAEs have been successfully applied to\nthe internal states of large language models to uncover\nmeaningful, semantic features [8, 13, 24]. For example, [8]\nfound that certain features in the sparse representation are\nactive only when specific entities, such as \u201cUS presidents,\u201d\nare mentioned in the text. Identifying which features corre-\nspond to specific concepts enables model steering, allowing\nfor direct control over model behavior by manipulating its\ninternal activations [2, 5]. The basic SAE framework can be\nextended with more advanced variants and sparsity regular-\nization techniques, which are detailed further in Section C.\nthe application of Sparse Autoencoders\n(SAEs) to diffusion models has been explored, with initial\nworks focusing on interpretability and concept unlearning\n[14, 36].\n\nRecently,\n\n3\n\n4. Method\n\nWe present a method for text-driven image editing that pro-\nvides both disentanglement and continuous control. Our\napproach is based on manipulating the text embeddings of\na frozen text-to-image model. We train a Sparse Autoen-\ncoder (SAE) on these embeddings, which provides a space\nin which disentangled directions corresponding to seman-\ntic attributes can be found. Editing is then performed by\nadjusting the embeddings along these directions to achieve\ncontrolled manipulations.\n\nSpecifically, given a frozen text encoder, we train a\nSparse Autoencoder (SAE) on its output embedding space\n(details in Sec. 4.1). The SAE is composed of an encoder,\nSenc, and a decoder Sdec. The encoder maps dense text em-\nbeddings into a high-dimensional, disentangled latent space\nwhere distinct semantic concepts are isolated, while the de-\ncoder reconstructs the original embedding from this sparse\nrepresentation. Once trained, manipulations are applied di-\nrectly in this sparse SAE\u2019s space by adjusting specific en-\ntries in the latent representation. The modified representa-\ntion is then passed through the SAE\u2019s decoder to recover\nan edited text embedding, which can be fed into any com-\npatible text-to-image model (e.g., Flux) that uses the same\ntext encoder architecture.\nIn this way, the SAE acts as\na lightweight, pluggable module that enables disentangled\nand semantic control over the final generated image.\n\nThe editing direction is obtained from a source prompt\nPsrc (e.g. a \u201cman\u201d) and target prompt Ptgt (e.g. \u201ca smil-\ning man\u201d) , details in Sec. 4.2. We apply the edit direction\nby multiplying it with a scale factor and adding it to the\nsparse representation of the specific source token in Psrc\nto be edited (e.g. the \u201cman\u201d token). The magnitude of the\nedit is dictated by this scale factor, allowing for continuous\ncontrol over the attribute\u2019s intensity (details in Sec. 4.3).\n\nWe demonstrate our method on the T5 text encoder [46],\nwhich is widely adopted as the text conditioning module in\nmany state-of-the-art text-to-image models. For the image\ngeneration backbone, which acts as a renderer for our text\nembedding manipulations, we primarily use the Flux [6]\ndiffusion transformer (DiT).\n\n4.1. SAE Training\n\nWe train our Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on a dataset of text\nembeddings. To create this dataset, we first process a cor-\npus of text prompts through the frozen T5 text encoder and\ncollect the resulting token embeddings, excluding padding\ntokens. Notably, unlike typical SAE applications that focus\non intermediate transformer layers, we train our SAE on the\nfinal output of the text encoder, as these are the exact repre-\nsentations that are continuously processed by the Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) throughout the denoising steps.\n\nThe SAE is trained on the embeddings of individual text\n\n\fFigure 3. We train the Sparse Autoencoder on token embeddings\nobtained from a frozen T5 encoder, using reconstruction and spar-\nsity losses.\n\ntokens, using the objective function from Eq. 1, the process\nillustrated in Fig. 3. Here, Lrec is the standard reconstruc-\ntion loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error) between the SAE\u2019s in-\nput and output embeddings. We control the target level of\nsparsity via another hyperparameter which sets the desired\nnumber of non-zero activations for each token\u2019s latent code.\n\n4.2. Obtaining an edit direction\n\nMotivated by prior work on SAEs in language models,\nwhich shows that specific entries in the sparse representa-\ntion activate only in the presence of particular semantic at-\ntributes [13, 24], we aim to detect such entries to construct\ndisentangled directions in the SAE\u2019s latent space for image\nediting. To do so, we use a source prompt Psrc (e.g. \u201ca\nwoman\u201d) and a target prompt Ptgt (e.g. \u201ca woman laugh-\ning\u201d). We first encode all text tokens in both prompts using\nthe SAE encoder, Senc, to obtain sparse token representa-\ntions. Since it is unknown apriori which tokens hold the\nsemantic information for a concept [35], we use element-\nwise max-pooling to aggregate their sparse representations\ninto a single, sparse vector for each prompt. As Psrc\nand Ptgt are semantically similar except for the edited at-\ntribute, the activated entries in maxpool(Senc(Psrc)) and\nmaxpool(Senc(Ptgt)) should overlap substantially, with\ntheir differences centering around entries corresponding to\nthe edit-specific attribute.\n\nTo identify the entries that correlate with the requested\nedit, we compute an entry-wise ratio, R, between the source\nand target prompt:\n\nR =\n\nmaxpool(Senc(Ptgt))\nmaxpool(Senc(Psrc)) + \u03f5\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03f5 is a small constant added for numerical stabil-\nity. The entries in R with the highest values correspond\nmost strongly to the edit-specific attribute. Next, to isolate\n\nFigure 4. Extracting Edit Directions. We derive an edit direction\nfrom a prompt pair that isolates a single attribute. Both prompts\nare encoded with the SAE, and their token representations are ag-\ngregated via max-pooling. By comparing the two resulting sparse\nvectors, we identify the key features corresponding to the desired\nchange. The edit direction is a sparse vector composed of only\nthese key features, taken from the target prompt\u2019s representation.\n\nthese key entries , we normalize the ratio vector, Rnorm =\nR/ max(R), and apply a predefined threshold \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nThis yields a set of indices, M , corresponding to the most\nrelevant entries for the edit:\n\nM = {i | Rnorm\n\ni\n\n> \u03c1}.\n\n(3)\n\nFinally, we use this set of indices to construct the disentan-\ngled edit direction, dedit, as a sparse vector, as illustrated in\nFig. 4. The direction is defined to be zero everywhere ex-\ncept at the identified indices, where it takes its values from\nthe target representation:\n\n(cid:40)\n\n[dedit]i =\n\n[Senc(Ptgt)]i\n0\n\nif i \u2208 M,\nif i /\u2208 M\n\n(4)\n\nImproving direction\u2019s robustness To enhance the ro-\nbustness of our derived edit directions, we aggregate in-\nformation from a set of multiple source-target prompt pairs\nrather than relying on a single pair. Given a desired edit,\ndefined by the pair of texts descriptions Psrc and Ptgt,\nwe use an LLM to construct N sentence pairs that share\nthe same underlying semantic relationship. This process,\ngeneralizes the specific edit into an abstract concept. For\nexample, to create a direction for \u201chappiness\u201d, the LLM\ngenerates pairs that add this attribute to various contexts,\nsuch as (\u201cman on the beach\u201d, \u201chappy man on the beach\u201d)\nand (\u201cman eating cake\u201d, \u201chappy man eating cake\u201d). We\nthen apply our direction-finding procedure to each of the\nN prompt pairs, resulting in a set of N steering vectors\n{di}N\ni=1. These vectors are stacked to form a direction ma-\ntrix: D = [d1, . . . , dN ]T .

Applying the edit direction. An aggregated edit direction is scaled to adjust edit magnitude and applied to the sparse representation\nof the relevant source token (e.g., man). The result is then decoded back into the T5 embedding space, and used to condition the text-to-\nimage model.\n\nand consistent direction representing the shared attribute\nacross all examples, we perform Singular Value Decompo-\nsition (SVD) on D. The singular vector corresponding to\nthe largest singular value is then selected as our final, ro-\nbust edit direction dedit.\n\n4.3. Applying the edit direction\n\nOnce the edit direction dedit is derived, we apply it to the\nsource prompt Psrc. To ensure the manipulation is local-\nized, we modify only the embedding of the specific token\nto be edited (e.g., the \u201cwoman\u201d token), which we denote as\netgt. The magnitude of the edit is controlled by a scalar fac-\ntor \u03c9, allowing for continuous, fine-grained control over the\nattribute\u2019s intensity.\n\nThe final, edited text embedding for the token, e\u2032\ntgt, is\nproduced by first encoding the original token\u2019s embedding\nwith Senc, adding the scaled direction in the sparse latent\nspace, and then decoding the result with Sdec:\n\ne\u2032\ntoken = Sdec(Senc(etgt) + \u03c9 \u00b7 dedit).\n\n(5)\n\nSetting \u03c9 = 0 recovers the original embedding, while pro-\ngressively increasing \u03c9 strengthens the visual effect. This\nnew token embedding, e\u2032\ntgt, replaces the original in the\nprompt.\n\nFinally, the manipulated text embeddings are used to\ncondition the renderer. Specifically, for diffusion models,\nwe follow the standard editing approach to preserve the\noverall structure of the source image. This involves us-\ning the same initial noise, xT , that was used to generate\nthe source image, and only substituting the original token\nembeddings with our modified ones. This ensures that the\nchanges in the final generated image are driven exclusively\nby our disentangled edit. Fig. 5 provides a schematic of this\nentire editing pipeline.\n\n4.4. Injection Schedule\n\nThe denoising process in diffusion models operates hier-\narchically: early timesteps are crucial for establishing the\nglobal structure and layout of an image, while later steps\nrefine fine-grained details and textures [3, 12, 31, 44, 59].\nConsequently, for fine-grained edits that aim to preserve\nthe original structure, prior work has shown that it is of-\nten optimal to begin the editing manipulation only at later\ntimesteps, after the core layout is formed [32, 33].\n\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce an exponential in-\njection schedule that applies the edit direction with increas-\ning intensity over time. For a base scale factor \u03c9 and diffu-\nsion step t, we define the time-dependent scale \u03c9t as:\n\n\u03c9t = min (cid:0)et\u00b7\u03c9 \u2212 1, \u03c4 (cid:1) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2208 R is a hyperparameter that acts as an upper\nbound on the edit strength. This exponential formulation of-\nfers a key advantage over linear schedules: it applies the edit\nvery gently in the early, structure-defining timesteps and\nprogressively increases its influence as the process moves\ninto the later, detail-refining stages. This gradual applica-\ntion better aligns with the hierarchical nature of image syn-\nthesis, preserving global structure while enabling powerful,\nfine-grained modifications.\n\n5. Experiments\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method\u2019s\nability to provide continuous control and disentangled edits\nthat preserve the subject\u2019s identity. Similar to prior work,\nwe focus our evaluation on human subjects, a challeng-\ning domain that demands strong disentanglement to pre-\nserve identity and offers the most meaningful application of\ncontinuous magnitude control. To demonstrate its model-\nagnostic nature, we apply our approach to both Flux [6] and\n\n5\n\nDiTMan sits in bar\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc9a(happy) Man sits in bar\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1cT5\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udf14\ud835\udc61\u22c5 \fOriginal image\n\nblonde + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nlaugh + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nmustache + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nold (man only) + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\n+ hat\n\nOriginal image\n\nsmile + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nAfrican-American + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\n+ glasses\n\nFigure 6.

Qualitative Results\n\nWe present qualitative results generated by our method,\nSAEdit, in Figures 1, 6, 7 and 8. Figure 6 shows a wide vari-\nety of continuous edits on human subjects. Our method suc-\ncessfully changes expressions (e.g., adding a smile), mod-\nify attributes (e.g., making hair blonde), and add accessories\n(e.g., hats or glasses). Crucially, these edits are highly lo-\ncalized. For instance, we demonstrate the ability to modify\n\nthe age of a single person in a multi-subject image while\nleaving the other person and the background entirely un-\ntouched. The results also highlight the continuous nature\nof our control. As shown in the examples, attributes such as\nthe intensity of a laugh or the degree of age can be smoothly\nscaled. This allows users to precisely tune the magnitude\nof the desired effect while the rest of the image content is\nfaithfully preserved.\n\nThe approach is not limited to human subjects and gen-\neralizes to a broad range of semantic concepts, as shown\nin Figure 8. Finally, to demonstrate the model-agnostic na-\nture of SAEdit, Figure 7 shows that the same edit directions\nproduce consistent, high-quality results when applied to a\ndifferent T5-based model, Stable Diffusion 3.5.\n\nWe provide additional qualitative results\n\nin Ap-\n\npendix B.1.\n\n6\n\n\ft\np\nm\no\nr\nP\ne\nl\ng\nn\ni\nS\n\ns\nt\np\nm\no\nr\np\nN\n+\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nc\ne\nj\nn\ni\np\nx\ne\n+\n\nOriginal image\n\nangry + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nFigure 9. Ablation study. We demonstrate how each component\nprogressively improves the quality of an \u2019angry\u2019 edit. A direc-\ntion from a single prompt pair results in a weak edit with unin-\ntended modifications. Aggregating N prompts produces a more\nrobust and semantically accurate direction, but can still alter fine\ndetails. Adding our exponential injection schedule preserves the\noriginal image\u2019s details (e.g., the necklace and hair color), yield-\ning the most faithful and disentangled result.\n\n5.2. Ablation\n\nFigure 9 provides a qualitative ablation study of our\nmethod\u2019s components, demonstrating their respective con-\ntributions to the final result. As a baseline, deriving an\nedit direction from a single prompt pair (top row) preserves\nthe subject\u2019s identity, but the intended semantic change\nto the expression is weak and insufficient. Aggregating\nthe direction from N prompt pairs (middle row) success-\nfully strengthens the edit as required, but causing minor\nunwanted changes to the hair color, the necklace, and the\ndress texture. Finally, incorporating our exponential injec-\ntion schedule (bottom row) resolves this issue by preserv-\ning these fine-grained details while maintaining the strong\nsemantic edit, thus achieving a high-quality and disentan-\ngled result. Our quantitative ablation study is detailed in\nAppendix B.3.\n\n5.3. Comparisons\n\nWe evaluate our method against several state-of-the-art ap-\nproaches for continuous image editing, highlighting its\nability to provide disentangled control without per-edit\noptimization. We compare against methods from both\noptimization-based and training-free categories. From the\noptimization-based group, we evaluate Concept Sliders [22]\nby using their official SDXL-trained LoRAs as well as Lo-\n\n7\n\nFigure 10. Quantitative comparison. We compare our method to\nother baselines on image preservation and prompt fidelity (top-\nright is better).\n\nRAs we trained on the Flux architecture for a direct com-\nparison. In the training-free category, we compare against\nFluxSpace [16], adjusting its \u03bbfine parameter to control edit\nmagnitude. We also evaluate against AttrCtrl [4], a method\nthat proposes both a training-free and an optimization-based\nvariant. For Flux Kontext [37], which does not natively\nsupport continuous edit scaling, we implement two proxy\nbaselines for magnitude control over the edit strength: the\nfirst involves varying the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)\nstrength, while the second uses an LLM to generate prompts\ncorresponding to \u2019light\u2019 and \u2019extreme\u2019 versions of each\nedit (instruction prompts and more details provided in Ap-\npendix B.4).\n\nQuantitative Comparisons To evaluate the fine-grained\nand continuous control of our method, we constructed a\ncustom evaluation set. This set is based on 63 images, each\ngenerated from a unique prompt created by a large language\nmodel\n[42]. Each prompt describes a scene containing a\nperson. For each source image, we applied a set of 6 to 8\ndifferent semantic edit directions, resulting in 432 unique\nedit scenarios. To assess the continuity of these edits, we\nthen generated each scenario at 3-5 distinct magnitude lev-\nels, producing a final evaluation set of at least 1,296 images\nper method. The complete list of prompts and edit direc-\ntions is provided in Appendix B.2. We quantitatively assess\nour method on two key axes: preservation and prompt ad-\nherence. To measure the preservation of original content,\nwe use LPIPS [60]. To prompt adherence with the edit, we\ncompute a VQA-based score [38]. This score is the delta\nbetween the VQA score of the edited image against the tar-\nget prompt and that of the source image against the same\nprompt, which isolates the semantic change introduced by\nthe edit.\n\nFigure 10 presents the quantitative comparison between\n\n\fOpponent\nMethod\n\nImage\nPres.\n\nPrompt\nAdher.\n\nOverall\n\nFlux Kontext (CFG)\nFlux Kontext (LLM)\nConceptSlider (Flux)\nFlux Space\n\n73%\n60%\n71%\n59%\n\n71%\n68%\n67%\n92%\n\n70%\n70%\n71%\n93%\n\nTable 1. User Study. Pairwise win rate of our method against other\nmethods.\n\nour method and other methods at varying levels of edit in-\ntensity. The results demonstrate that our method outper-\nforms all other approaches. Notably, our zero-shot method\nis superior even to task-specific techniques that are explic-\nitly trained for each edit type. This indicates that our ap-\nproach successfully achieves the dual goals of high seman-\ntic accuracy for the required edit and strong preservation\nof the original content. Furthermore, the metrics show a\nsmooth and predictable progression as the edit magnitude\nincreases, confirming that our method provides true contin-\nuous control and allows users to precisely tune the intensity\nof an effect.\n\nUser Study To complement our quantitative analysis, we\nconducted a user study to evaluate the perceptual quality\nof our method against competing approaches. For fair-\nness, we limited our comparison to methods that also use\nthe Flux model, ensuring the source images were as sim-\nilar as possible.\nIn a pairwise comparison, we presented\nparticipants with results from our method and a competing\nmethod, showing three distinct levels of edit intensity for\neach to assess continuous control. Users were asked to state\ntheir preference based on three criteria: Image Preservation,\nPrompt Alignment (which included the gradualness of the\neffect), and Overall Quality. In total, our user study gath-\nered 390 pairwise comparison responses. More details in\nAppendix B.6\n\nThe results, summarized in Table 1, show that our\nmethod was significantly preferred over all other ap-\nproaches in all categories. This suggests that users found\nour edits achieve a better balance of successfully applying\nthe desired change while faithfully preserving the original\nimage content.\n\nQualitative Comparisons Figure 11 presents a qualita-\ntive comparison between our method and other approaches,\nall operating on the Flux model. While the results for most\nmethods are taken directly from our quantitative evalua-\ntion set, we manually optimized the prompts for the Flux\nKontext baselines to ensure the strongest possible compari-\nson, as their default outputs were often suboptimal (see Ap-\npendix B.5). For example, for the CFG-based baseline, we\nfound the prompt \u201cMake the man look slightly like a kid\u201d\nwith CFG scales of 1.5 and 1.6 yielded the most plausi-\n\ns\nr\ne\nd\ni\nl\nS\nt\np\ne\nc\nn\no\nC\n\n)\ng\nf\nc\n(\n\nt\nx\ne\nt\nn\no\nK\nx\nu\nl\nF\n\ne\nc\na\np\nS\nx\nu\nl\nF\n\ns\nr\nu\nO\n\nOriginal image\n\nyoung + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nFigure 11.

Our method (bottom row) produces a\nmore disentangled result that better preserves the subject\u2019s identity\ncompared to the competing approaches.\n\nble results. The visual comparison highlights the superior\ndisentanglement of our method. For instance, in contrast to\nConceptSliders, our approach achieves a perfect reconstruc-\ntion of the subject\u2019s jacket while applying the desired edit.\nSimilarly, when compared to Flux Kontext, our method suc-\ncessfully modifies the subject\u2019s age in a more natural and\ngradual manner, demonstrating more precise control over\nthe semantic attributes. More results in Appendix B.5.\n\nReal image editing Our method\u2019s applicability extends\nto the challenging task of real image editing. To achieve\nthis, we first use a state-of-the-art inversion technique, Uni-\nInv Flow [33], to obtain the initial noise corresponding\nto a given source image. Our SAE-based manipulation\nis then applied to the text embeddings as previously de-\nscribed. Figure 12 presents several results of this combined\napproach. As shown, we can apply high-fidelity, continuous\nedits to real photographs, successfully modifying expres-\nsions (cry, laughing) and attributes (old). Importantly, these\nedits preserve the subject\u2019s core identity and background\ndetails, demonstrating that our disentangled control is ef-\nfective even in the demanding context of real image manip-\nulation.\n\n8\n\n\fOriginal image\n\ncry + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nold + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nlaughing + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nOriginal image\n\nlaughing + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nFigure 12. Real Image Editing with Image Inversion. Our method seamlessly integrates with inversion techniques, allowing for high-fidelity\nedits on real-world images. Leveraging UniFlow [33] to invert the source image into the diffusion model\u2019s latent space, we demonstrate\ncontinuous control over expressions and attributes. The edits maintain the subject\u2019s identity and background fidelity across all intensity\nlevels.\n\nOrignal Image\n\n+ beard\n\nOrignal Image\n\n+ green\n\nFigure 13. Our method struggles with out-of-distribution (OOD)\nedits that conflict with strong priors in the base model. For exam-\nple, applying a \u201cbeard\u201d edit changes the woman into a man (left),\nwhile making the dog \u201cgreen\u201d results in an unnatural, animated-\nstyle dog (right).\n\n5.4. Limitations\n\nWhile our method identifies robust and disentangled edit\ndirections, we observe that further refinement is sometimes\npossible. For certain complex edits, manually selecting or\nde-selecting a few specific entries in the sparse direction\nvector can yield even more disentangled results.\n\nIn addition, our method\u2019s ability to disentangle is con-\nstrained by the inherent biases of the underlying text-to-\nimage model. When an edit is requested that is strongly\nout-of-distribution (OOD), our approach can fail to main-\ntain disentanglement. As shown in Figure 13, attempting to\nadd a \u2019beard\u2019 to a \u201cwoman\u201d results in the subject\u2019s perceived\ngender being changed to male. Similarly, making a dog\n\u201cgreen\u201d alters its texture to appear unnatural and cartoon-\nlike. We hypothesize these failures occur because the SAE\ncannot fully separate concepts that are fundamentally en-\ntangled in the base model\u2019s worldview.\n\n6. Conclusions\nIn this work, we introduced a novel framework that pro-\nvides both disentangled and continuous control for text-to-\nimage editing. Our method leverages a Sparse Autoencoder\n(SAE) on text embeddings to create a sparse representation\n\n9\n\nwhere semantic attributes are isolated. This sparse represen-\ntation is the key to our method\u2019s success. Having isolated\nindividual attributes facilitates disentangled edits, where the\nsubject\u2019s core identity is preserved. Our approach enables\ntoken-level manipulation, providing fine-grained and con-\ntinuous control over the magnitude of a given attribute.\n\nA key advantage of our design is that editing is decou-\npled from rendering: we modify only the text embedding,\nenabling any compatible text-to-image backbone model to\nact as the renderer. SAEs are primarily known for their role\nin interpretability of language models, yet in this work we\ndemonstrate that they can be harnessed for image genera-\ntion, yielding fine-grained editing capabilities. Image edit-\ning has recently seen remarkable progress, yet precise fine-\ngrained control remains an open challenge, and we believe\nthis work will encourage further advances in that direction.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Yuval Alaluf, Daniel Garibi, Or Patashnik, Hadar Averbuch-\nElor, and Daniel Cohen-Or.

Implementation Details\n\nWe illustrate our method with the T5-XXL text en-\ncoder [46], which is utilized by state-of-the-art text-to-\nimage models such as Flux.dev [6] and Stable Diffusion\n3.5 [21]. To train the SAE, we compiled a dataset from\nthe DiffusionDB dataset [58], containing\ntwo sources:\n2M general image captions, and the HumanCaption-10M\ndataset [15], which provides 10M captions focused on hu-\nmans. The combined training set consists of 12M text\nprompts, totaling approximately 800M text tokens after fil-\ntering.\n\nThe dimension of the SAE\u2019s latent space is set to 65,536,\nand the target number of active entries for each token is 300.\nWe trained the SAE for 200,000 steps using the Adam op-\ntimizer with a learning rate of 0.003. The weight for the\nsparsity loss, \u03b1 (from Eq. 1), was set to 1\n32 .\n\nFor each edit, the corresponding direction was derived\nusing a set of n = 100 source and target prompt pairs.\nThese prompt pairs were generated using GPT-5. The pa-\nrameter \u03c4 (from Eq. 6) used for the exponential injection\nmechanism was set to be a function of the scale parameter:\n\u03c4 = 15 \u00b7 \u03c9.\n\nB. Experiments\n\nB.1. Additional Qualitative Results\n\nFigure 14 showcases the universality of our learned edit di-\nrections. We apply the exact same set of four directions\n(smile, angry, surprised, and old) to four diverse source im-\nages, demonstrating that a single direction vector can gener-\nalize effectively across different subjects, scenes, and iden-\ntities.\n\nFigure 15 demonstrates the compositionality of our\nlearned directions, where we independently control a\n\u201csmile\u201d on the horizontal axis and the addition of \u201cglasses\u201d\non the vertical axis. It is evident that these manipulations are\nhighly disentangled, as the subject\u2019s identity and all back-\nground details remain perfectly consistent across the grid,\nwith only the intended attributes changing.\n\nWe further demonstrate the compositionality and ad-\nvanced localization capabilities of our method in Figure 17.\nThe figure showcases the simultaneous application of two\ndistinct edits targeted at different subjects within the same\nscene. A \u201claugh\u201d direction is applied to the woman, while\nan \u201cold\u201d direction is applied to the man. The results across\nthe grid show that each manipulation is successfully con-\nfined to its intended target, preserving the background and\nthe non-targeted attributes of each subject without interfer-\nence.\n\nFigures 22 and 18 present additional qualitative results\n\nfor continuous editing on human and non-human subjects,\nrespectively.\n\nB.2. Benchmark Details\n\nAs mentioned in the main paper, we constructed a custom\nbenchmark for our comparative evaluation. The process be-\ngan with a large language model (LLM) [42], which we\nused to generate 21 diverse source prompts. For each of\nthese prompts, we generated images using 3 different ran-\ndom seeds, resulting in a set of 63 unique source images.\nFinally, we applied between 6 to 8 different semantic edits\nto each source image, depending on the applicability of the\nedit to the subject. The complete list of source prompts and\nthe specific edits applied to each are detailed in Table 3.\n\nB.3. Quantitative Ablation\n\nTo quantitatively measure the contribution of each compo-\nnent of our method, we conduct an ablation study on our\nbenchmark, with results shown in Figure 16. We evaluate\nthree variants of our approach: (1) deriving an edit direc-\ntion from a single prompt pair, (2) aggregating directions\nfrom N prompts but without our proposed injection sched-\nule, and (3) our full method which includes the exponential\ninjection schedule.\n\nThe plot of VQA score (prompt alignment) versus LPIPS\nscore (image preservation) reveals the contribution of each\ncomponent. The single-prompt version serves as our initial\nbaseline and produces a less pronounced semantic change,\nresulting in a significantly lower VQA score. Aggregating\nN prompts drastically improves prompt alignment, yield-\ning a much higher VQA score. Our full method, which\nadds the exponential injection schedule, maintains the high\nprompt alignment gained from using N prompts while sig-\nnificantly improving image preservation, achieving superior\nLPIPS scores at all intermediate intensity levels. This vali-\ndates that both components are crucial for achieving a state-\nof-the-art balance between edit accuracy and preservation.\n\n.\n\nB.4. Flux Kontext Baseline\n\nSince Flux Kontext [37] lacks a native mechanism for con-\ntinuous edit scaling, we implemented two distinct proxy\nbaselines to evaluate different edit intensities. The first,\nwhich we term Flux Kontext1 (LLM), controls the edit mag-\nnitude by using three different instruction prompts (\u2019light\u2019,\n\u2019medium\u2019, and \u2019extreme\u2019) generated by an LLM, as detailed\nin Table 2. The second baseline, Flux Kontext2 (CFG), uses\nthe fixed \u2019medium\u2019 instruction prompt and instead varies\nthe Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scale to achieve differ-\nent levels of edit strength.\n\n12\n\n\foriginal image\n\nSmile direction\n\nAngry direction\n\nSurprised direction\n\nOld direction\n\nFigure 14. Each row shows a different source image (leftmost column) and its edits along four semantic directions: smile, angry, surprised,\nand old. The images in each column are generated by adding the same direction, showcasing the generality of the directions found by our\nmethod\n\nB.5. Qualitative Comparisons (Continued)\n\nTo further evaluate our approach, we provide qualitative\ncomparisons against existing methods,\nincluding FluxS-\npace [16], Concept-Sliders [22], and two variants of Flux\nKontext [37]: Flux Kontext1 (LLM), which leverages\nan LLM to craft prompts for gradual editing, and Flux\nKontext2 (Cfg), which uses the cfg score to guide edits. Re-\nsults are presented in Figures 11 and 21.\n\nIn Figure 11 (left), competing methods fail to introduce\na meaningful edit, whereas our method produces a clear and\nconsistent modification. On the right, several baselines ei-\nther fail to perform the edit or induce significant identity\nchanges. Notably, both Flux Kontext variants are unable\nto achieve gradual edits and distort subject proportions, of-\nten enlarging the head unnaturally. By contrast, our method\n\ngenerates edits that are gradual and identity-preserving.\n\nFigure 21 further illustrates these differences. On the\nleft, competing methods fail\nto add a beard, produce\nabrupt transitions, or generate unnatural appearances. Our\napproach successfully creates a gradual, natural-looking\nbeard. On the right, most baselines again yield non-gradual\nchanges or identity shifts, while our method produces clear,\nprogressive edits that maintain subject identity.\n\nB.6. User study\n\nAs reported in the main text, we conducted a user study to\nfurther evaluate the perceptual quality of our method. For\nthis study, we randomly sampled 20 edit scenarios from our\nquantitative evaluation benchmark.\n\nIn each question, we performed a pairwise comparison.\nParticipants were shown the three levels of edit intensity\n\n13\n\n\fsmiling + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nlaugh (woman) + \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\ns\nu\nn\ng\nl\na\ns\ns\ne\ns\n\n+\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\n\nFigure 15.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before\nproducing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical\ntasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for\nmodel deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single\nsampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from\nstochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference\noptimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and\npropose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,\ndrop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based\nestimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling\nreasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces\ntrace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form\nchoice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the\ntrue marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,\ntightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.\nEmpirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points\non AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on\ngeneral conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base\nmodels by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.\nThese results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and\ndemonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more\nstable training and stronger overall performance.",

Despite this\npromise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges, especially in training-free set-\ntings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the search distribution by maintaining\nmultiple implicit paths, which diffuses probability mass, introduces noise, and\nimpedes convergence to a single high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accu-\nracy; and 2) overthinking persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and\ndegrading efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SWIREASONING, a\ntraining-free framework for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations:\n1) SWIREASONING dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning,\nguided by block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token dis-\ntributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely conver-\ngence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches, SWIREA-\nSONING curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying prob-\nlem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks, SWIREA-\nSONING consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%\u20132.8% across reasoning\nLLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under constrained\nbudgets, SWIREASONING improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%, with\nlarger gains as budgets tighten.\n\n\u2020Equal advising.\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fSWIREASONING\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nReasoning is one of the central capabilities of large language models (LLMs) (Yang et al., 2025;\nQwen Team, 2024; Meta, 2025a;b). It allows models to tackle complex tasks such as mathematics,\nscience, and programming (Guo et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025b; Jaech et al., 2024; Agarwal et al.,\n2025; Qwen Team, 2025; Abdin et al., 2025; Abouelenin et al., 2025; Anthropic, 2025; DeepMind,\n2024a;b), far beyond simple question answering.\n\nA key limitation of the dominant reasoning approach, explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) (Wolf et al.,\n2020; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023a; Goyal et al., 2024; Pfau et al., 2024), lies in the reliance\non discrete tokens during inference. In standard CoT decoding, the model commits to a single token\nat each step, sampled from the predicted distribution. While effective and ensures readability by\nverbalizing intermediate steps, this discrete process collapses the full probability distribution into a\nsingle trajectory, discarding uncertainty and eliminating many potentially useful reasoning paths.\n\nTo overcome this bottleneck, recent work has explored an alternative reasoning technique, latent\nreasoning (Hao et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025; Cheng & Van Durme, 2024; Xu et al., 2025a;b; Tan\net al., 2025), where the model operates directly in a continuous hidden space instead of a discrete text\nspace. Latent reasoning offers two key advantages over CoT: 1) higher representational bandwidth\nper step, since hidden vectors can encode richer information than single tokens (Zhu et al., 2025b);\nand 2) the ability to preserve multiple reasoning hypotheses implicitly, rather than collapsing them\nprematurely into one tokenized path (Li et al., 2025b; Chen et al., 2025).\n\nLatent reasoning can be broadly categorized into training-required and training-free approaches.\nTraining-required ones (Hao et al., 2024; Su et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2025; Tack\net al., 2025) demand substantial retraining or fine-tuning (Yue et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Wang\net al., 2025a; Zhu et al., 2025a), making it excessively expensive to apply to large reasoning language\nmodels. In contrast, training-free approaches like Soft-Thinking (Zhang et al., 2025), which form\na probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings as inputs, operate directly at inference time\nwithout incurring additional training costs. Our work focuses on the latter category, which is cost-\neffective and resource-friendly for deployment in large-scale reasoning models.\n\nAlthough training-free latent reasoning eliminates the need for costly retraining, operating purely\nin the latent space also presents significant challenges. First, the model is not explicitly trained to\nperform long-horizon reasoning with latent inputs. As a result of distributional mismatches, when\ninference relies solely on latent trajectories, the process is less controlled and can easily drift off\nInstead of collapsing into a single path, the model tends to spread\ncourse (Chen et al., 2025).\nprobability mass across many implicit reasoning paths. While this preserves multiple hypotheses,\nit also introduces persistent noise, slows convergence, and ultimately harms reasoning accuracy (Li\net al., 2025b). Second, the absence of explicit tokens does not necessarily ensure efficiency. In\nlatent space, models may still suffer from repetitive or unnecessarily extended internal deliberations\nand continuation (Zhang et al., 2025), essentially overthinking. This prolongs inference and over-\nconsumes tokens, undermining the very efficiency that latent reasoning is meant to improve.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces SWIREASONING (abbreviated as SWIR) as a training-\nfree framework for LLM reasoning that alternates between explicit and latent thinking, based on\nblock-wise confidence inferred from entropy trends of next-token distributions, and suppresses over-\nthinking by bounding the number of switches. More specifically, the framework first tracks a refer-\nence entropy within each thinking block to reflect block-wise confidence. Rising confidence triggers\nan explicit switch to consolidate progress along a single path, while sustained uncertainty triggers\na latent switch to re-explore in continuous space. Second, a switch count controller caps the num-\nber of thinking block transitions and provides early-answer checkpoints, curbing unnecessary latent\nloops and improving token efficiency across difficulties.\n\nThe proposed framework also benefits from reintroducing diversity by sampling in an explicit think-\ning block when compared to pure latent thinking. Even though motivated differently, SWIREASON-\nING resonates with the concurrent observation of Liang et al. (2025) that introducing stochasticity\nbenefits latent reasoning, but we achieve this via a distinct mode switch mechanism rather than\ninjecting distributions with randomness.\n\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n2\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\n\u2022 We propose SWIREASONING, a training-free reasoning framework that dynamically alternates be-\ntween explicit and latent thinking based on confidence signals, thereby exploiting the expressivity\nof latent thinking without sacrificing the stability of explicit thinking.\n\n\u2022 We introduce a switch count control mechanism that caps the number of transitions, enabling early\nanswering based on partial reasoning trajectories at switch boundaries. This effectively suppresses\noverthinking and improves token efficiency under limited budgets.\n\n\u2022 We extensively validate the effectiveness of SWIREASONING on mathematics and STEM rea-\nsoning domains across multiple benchmarks, model families, and sizes, demonstrating consistent\ngains in both accuracy and token efficiency over training-free baselines.\n\n2 RELATED WORK\n\nExplicit LLM Reasoning. Reasoning via explicit intermediate text has been extensively studied.\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting elicits stepwise rationales that improve reasoning accuracy by\ndecomposing problems into natural-language sub-steps (Kojima et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Sub-\nsequent work increases robustness by aggregating multiple CoT trajectories through self-consistency\n(Wang et al., 2022). Search- and tool-augmented variants further expand the exploration space, such\nas Tree-of-thought that branches over partial rationales (Yao et al., 2023a) and interleaving reason-\ning and actions with external tools and environments (Yao et al., 2023b). Least-to-most prompting\nprogressively solves subproblems to reduce reasoning load and mitigate error accumulation (Zhou\net al., 2022). These approaches operate purely in the discrete token space and therefore commit to a\nsingle token at each step. While readable, the discretizations in explicit reasoning discard alternative\nhypotheses early, and restrict the information bandwidth per step (Zhu et al., 2025b).\n\nLatent LLM Reasoning. Latent reasoning operates in the continuous representation space rather\nthan discrete natural language space used by explicit reasoning. Prior work can be broadly grouped\ninto two categories. 1) Training-required approaches modify pretraining (Tack et al., 2025; Zeng\net al., 2025) or fine-tuning objectives (Tan et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a;b; Jiang et al., 2025;\nWu et al., 2025; Yue et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a; Shen et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025a) to super-\nvise hidden-state trajectories or to endow models with latent-planning skills. 2) Training-free ap-\nproaches (Zhang et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2025) intervene only at inference time by manipulating\nhidden representations or probability distributions without updating model weights. Our work be-\nlongs to the training-free category but differs from prior single-mode methods. Instead of remaining\npurely latent, SWIREASONING dynamically switches between latent and explicit reasoning based\non entropy-trend confidence, and further regulates the number of switches through a count controller\nto suppress overthinking and improve efficiency.\n\n3 METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1 SWIREASONING OVERVIEW\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, SWIREASONING is a training-free framework that dynamically alternates be-\ntween explicit and latent reasoning. The number of switches is regulated to suppress overthinking\nand improve token efficiency. Sec. 3.2 presents the preliminaries of explicit and latent reasoning,\nSec. 3.3 details the design of the dynamic switch, and Sec. 3.4 discusses the switch count control\nmechanism. Implementation details are provided in Appendix B.1.\n\n3.2 PRELIMINARY: EXPLICIT AND TRAINING-FREE LATENT THINKING\n\nExplicit Thinking. Let V be a vocabulary and p\u03b8(xt | x<t) a LLM over V with parameters \u03b8.\nGiven a question q, the model produces a reasoning trace r1:T \u2208 V T followed by a final answer\na1:U \u2208 V U . We write the concatenated sequence as\n\nx1:(|q|+T +U ) = (cid:2)q, r1:T , a1:U\n\n(cid:3),\n\n3\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\nFigure 3: SWIREASONING framework. (a) Dynamic mode switching alternates between explicit and latent\nthinking based on block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends. (b) A switch count control mechanism\nlimits the maximum number of thinking-block transitions, suppressing overthinking before the final answer.\n\nAt inference, decoding proceeds by repeatedly choosing a token xt from the predictive distribution\np\u03b8(\u00b7 | x<t) according to a policy \u03c0t(\u00b7), e.g.,\n\nxt \u223c \u03c0t(\u00b7) with \u03c0t =\n\n(cid:40)\n\nGreedy: arg maxv\u2208V p\u03b8(v | x<t),\nSampling: Top-k/Top-p with temperature \u03c4.\n\nThe reasoning phase stops when a termination condition is met, e.g., generating \u27e8/think\u27e9, after which\nthe answer tokens a1:U are decoded in the same manner. While explicit reasoning improves reliabil-\nity by externalizing intermediate steps, its hard policy \u03c0t(\u00b7) collapses the full distribution to a single\ndiscrete decision at each step, i.e., discards information in p\u03b8(\u00b7 | x<t) beyond the chosen token.\n\nIt replaces the hard policy \u03c0t(\u00b7) by a continuous surrogate that\nTraining-Free Latent Thinking.\npreserves distributional information. Let E \u2208 R|V |\u00d7d denote the token embedding matrix with rows\ne(v) \u2208 Rd. At step t, the model yields logits \u2113t \u2208 R|V | and pt = softmax(\u2113t). Given the next-token\ndistribution pt := p\u03b8(\u00b7 | x<t) \u2208 \u2206|V |\u22121, it forms a soft embedding\n\n\u02dcet =\n\n(cid:88)\n\nv\u2208V\n\npt[v] e(v) \u2208 Rd,\n\n(1)\n\nand feeds \u02dcet back to the model as the next input representation, rather than committing to an explicit\ntoken by \u03c0t(\u00b7). Upon the thinking phase being complete, the policy reverts to \u03c0t(\u00b7) for answer\ngeneration. The convexity of Eq. 1 ensures \u02dcet lies in the embedding hull of E, retaining all first-\norder uncertainty in pt, which reduces information discards and increases robustness to local noise.\n\n3.3 DYNAMIC SWITCH BETWEEN EXPLICIT AND LATENT THINKING\n\nRemaining in a single mode throughout reasoning is inherently suboptimal: explicit thinking pro-\nvides readability but may discard useful information beyond chosen tokens, while latent thinking\npreserves richer signals but can drift into noise and reduce accuracy. Our key insight is that reasoning\nshould switch modes based on confidence. Latent reasoning enables exploration across multiple po-\ntential continuations when confidence is low, and explicit reasoning encourages convergence when\nconfidence is high, striking a balance that supports broad exploration while maintaining accuracy.\n\nMode Switch Criterion. We refer to the reasoning content between two consecutive switches as\na thinking block and estimate its confidence by entropy Ht = \u2212 (cid:80)\nv pt[v] log pt[v]. Let \u00afH denote the\nreference entropy of the current block, which is initialized at the first step of the block and refreshed\nwhen a mode switch happens. We use a criterion that converts local entropy trends into decisions:\n\nLatent \u2192 Explicit :\n\nExplicit \u2192 Latent :\n\n(cid:0)Ht < \u00afH(cid:1) (confidence rises),\n(cid:0)Ht > \u00afH(cid:1) (confidence drops),\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n4\n\nReasoning LLMsReasoning LLMsEiEjXkEkXl...<think>Mixing:WeightedVocabulary:Embeddings:E1E2E3X1X2X3Mixing</think>PositionEntropy0ConfidentUnconfidentPositionEntropy0ConfidentUnconfident...

To avoid oscillations, we impose dwell windows upon the mode switch\ncriterion. Formally, with mode variable mt \u2208 {Explicit, Latent} and dwell step counter \u2206t, we\nhave\n\nmt+1 =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\n\uf8f3\n\nExplicit, mt = Latent \u2227 (Ht < \u00afH) \u2227 (\u2206t \u2265 WL\u2192E),\nLatent, mt = Explicit \u2227 (Ht > \u00afH) \u2227 (\u2206t \u2265 WE\u2192L),\nmt,\n\notherwise.\n\nWe reset \u00afH \u2190 Ht, \u2206t \u2190 0 upon any switch, i.e., mt+1 \u0338= mt. Otherwise, we update \u2206t \u2190 \u2206t+1. In\npractice, WL\u2192E = 0 while WE\u2192L is positive, i.e., a Latent\u2192Explicit switch may occur immediately\nwhen Ht dips, whereas an Explicit\u2192Latent switch requires staying for at least WE\u2192L steps.\n\nThe key intuition behind the asymmetric design is that two modes play different roles in reasoning.\nLatent reasoning is inherently divergent, allowing for rich exploration. However, prolonging the\nlatent phase after confidence has recovered is counterproductive. It increases the risks of introducing\nspurious signals that may mislead the model. Therefore, once confidence rises, an immediate switch\nback to explicit reasoning is necessary to consolidate progress onto a single coherent trajectory.\n\nIn contrast, explicit reasoning is convergent, gradually unfolding a chain-of-thought where each\ntoken incrementally extends the current logical path. If the model were allowed to switch back to\nlatent reasoning at the first sign of an entropy fluctuation, spurious short-term uncertainty could\ntrigger oscillations. The dwell window WE\u2192L ensures that explicit reasoning is given sufficient\nopportunity to stabilize and accumulate meaningful structure.\n\nThinking-Related Signal Mixing. To better align mode switches with the LLMs\u2019 learned rea-\nsoning patterns, we blend the embeddings of thinking-related signal tokens, e.g., <think> and\n</think>, when a switch occurs. Let e\u27e8think\u27e9 and e\u27e8/think\u27e9 denote their embeddings. At the en-\ntrance to a latent thinking block, we bias the first latent step t\u22c6 toward \u201cbegin thinking\u201d by\n\n\u02dcet\u22c6 \u2190 \u03b1t\u22c6 \u00b7\u02dcet\u22c6 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1t\u22c6 )\u00b7e\u27e8think\u27e9,\n\n\u03b1t\u22c6 \u2208 [0, 1],\n\n(4)\n\nand at the exit to an explicit thinking block, we bias the first explicit step t\u2020 toward \u201cend thinking\u201d\n(5)\n\n\u02dcet\u2020 \u2190 \u03b2t\u2020 \u00b7\u02dcet\u2020 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2t\u2020 )\u00b7e\u27e8/think\u27e9,\n\n\u03b2t\u2020 \u2208 [0, 1],\n\nwhich encourages the model to close the latent phase and move on to answer production. In practice,\nwe schedule \u03b1t = \u03b10 + (1 \u2212 \u03b10)\n, where Tmax is a predefined\nmaximum generation length, and apply Eq. 4 or Eq. 5 only at the steps when switches occur.\n\nand \u03b2t = \u03b20 + (1 \u2212 \u03b20)\n\nt\nTmax\n\nt\nTmax\n\n3.4 OVERTHINKING SUPPRESSION BY SWITCH COUNT CONTROL\n\nEven with confidence-aware switching, reasoning LLMs may still overthink. Therefore, we place a\nbound on the total number of Latent\u2192Explicit switches. Our key insight is that each switch natu-\nrally marks the end of a thinking block where partial reasoning trajectories have been consolidated,\nwhich may already contain sufficient evidence for arriving at a reasonable solution. Under limited\nbudgets, generating answers at these natural checkpoints can make use of partial reasoning trajecto-\nries, offering a chance to obtain correct predictions earlier without consuming additional tokens.\n\nCounter and Triggers. Let Ct count completed Latent \u2192 Explicit switches up to step t. Given a\nuser-specified budget Cmax, we define two triggers:\n\n\u2022 Convergence trigger (at 1\n\n2 Cmax \u2264 Ct \u2264 Cmax on Latent \u2192 Explicit transitions): force the next\ntoken to be \u27e8/think\u27e9. The convergence trigger is to encourage rather than enforce the end of the\nthinking process and the start of converging to an answer based on partial reasoning trajectories.\n\u2022 Termination trigger (at Ct > Cmax on a subsequent Latent \u2192 Explicit transition): inject a\nconcise answer prefix sfinal, \u201c\u27e8/think\u27e9\\n\\n The final answer is\u201d, then allow at most B additional\ntokens for the final answer. The termination trigger is to enforce an immediate answer generation.\n\nTriggers are implemented as short injection queues that overwrite future-generated tokens. Formally,\nlet Qt be the per-sample injection queue. When a convergence or termination trigger fires, we set\nQt \u2190 [ID(\u27e8/think\u27e9)] or [ID(sfinal)]. At the next step, if Qt \u0338= \u2205, we deterministically set xt \u2190\nQt.pop(). For the termination trigger, we also start a budget counter bt = B and decrement it each\nstep after the termination trigger fires. Decoding will be terminated once bt = 0.\n\n5\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\n4 EXPERIMENTS\n\n4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS\n\nModels. We evaluate SWIREASONING on three recent reasoning LLMs: Qwen3-8B (Yang et al.,\n2025), DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (Guo et al., 2025), and Qwen3-1.7B (Yang et al., 2025). This\nselection helps us validate the effectiveness of SWIREASONING across different model families,\nmodel scales, and training paradigms.\n\nDomains and Benchmarks. We evaluate SWIREASONING thoroughly on five benchmarks, in-\ncluding GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), Math500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021), AIME 2024 (Hug-\ngingFaceH4, 2024), AIME 2025 (Yentinglin, 2025) for mathematics reasoning, and GPQA Dia-\nmond (Rein et al., 2024) for STEM reasoning. More details are provided in Appendix B.2.\n\nBaselines. We compare SWIREASONING that dynamically switches between thinking modes\nagainst three baselines with a single thinking mode, including 1) explicit thinking alone: standard\nCoT reasoning with sampling, standard CoT reasoning with greedy decoding, and 2) training-free\nlatent thinking alone: Soft Thinking (Zhang et al., 2025).\n\nMetrics. We use the Pass@1 metric to evaluate reasoning accuracy, and token efficiency E to\nassess the level of reasoning efficiency. Let Accm(\u2113) \u2208 [0, 1] denote the accuracy of method m\nwhen using \u2113 generated tokens. Its plain token efficiency is the accuracy gained per token,\n\nP Em(\u2113) =\n\nAccm(\u2113)\n\u2113\n\n.\n\nTo express efficiency in units relative to the standard CoT, we normalize it by the CoT\u2019s plain token\nefficiency when the highest accuracy is achieved. Specifically, if CoT achieves its highest accuracy\nAcc\u22c6\n\n. The token efficiency of m is defined as\n\nCoT tokens, denote P E\u22c6\n\nCoT using \u2113\u22c6\n\nCoT\n\n\u2113\u22c6\nCoT\n\nCoT = Acc\u22c6\nP Em(\u2113)\nP E\u22c6\n\nCoT\n\nEm(\u2113) =\n\n=\n\nAccm(\u2113)/\u2113\nCoT/\u2113\u22c6\n\nAcc\u22c6\n\nCoT\n\n.\n\nAnd the average efficiency gain of method m over CoT is\n\nE[\u2206Em] =\n\n(cid:82) (Em(\u2113) \u2212 ECoT(\u2113)) d\u2113\n(cid:82) ECoT(\u2113) d\u2113\n\n.\n\n4.2 REASONING ACCURACY UNDER UNLIMITED TOKEN BUDGETS\n\nWe first evaluate SWIREASONING in the setting where token budgets are set large enough to en-\nsure that each method is allowed to conduct sufficient thinking (refer to Appendix B.2 for de-\ntailed settings). Fig. 1 and Tab. 1 report the highest attainable accuracies across mathematics\n(GSM8K, MATH500, AIME24, AIME25) and STEM (GPQA Diamond) benchmarks under this\nsetting. Across different model families of varying sizes, SWIREASONING consistently achieves\nhigher Pass@1 accuracy than CoT with sampling, CoT with greedy decoding, and Soft Thinking.\n\nOur observation is that improvements are most pronounced on the more challenging benchmarks.\nFor instance, on AIME24/AIME25, which require deep deductive reasoning and are widely re-\ngarded as more difficult, our method yields absolute gains of 3.34%/2.50% on Qwen3-8B, and\n5.00%/5.00% on Qwen3-1.7B. These margins substantially exceed those observed on GSM8K\nor MATH500 with lower difficulty, suggesting that the proposed switching mechanism is particu-\nlarly beneficial when problems involve long reasoning chains or higher uncertainty from the LLM\u2019s\nperspective. Overall, the accuracy results under unlimited token budgets highlight the strength of\nSWIREASONING in better addressing reasoning tasks compared to single-mode approaches.\n\n4.3 TOKEN EFFICIENCY UNDER LIMITED TOKEN BUDGETS\n\nAcross models and benchmarks, SWIREASONING consistently attains improved Pareto frontiers.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the peak efficiency gains range between 4.6\u00d7 and 6.8\u00d7 over CoT depending\n\n6\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\nTable 1: Comparison of SWIREASONING and CoT with sampling, CoT with greedy decoding, and Soft Think-\ning on mathematics and STEM benchmarks.

These improvements are not confined to a single budget: the area-under-curve\n(AUC) advantage persists across a broad range of small to moderate budgets.\n\nOne observation from Fig. 4 is that the relatively large average efficiency gains occur on GSM8K,\nMATH500, and GPQA Diamond across three models (up to 213% AUC improvements in the per-\nbenchmark panels). These tasks contain many instances with lower difficulty, which benefit most\nfrom our overthinking suppression design to obtain the correct answer with partial reasoning trajec-\ntories. In contrast, on AIME24/25, the efficiency gaps are smaller, while the accuracy gains with\nunlimited budgets are larger. This asymmetry is expected: the harder the problem is, the more diffi-\ncult it is to predict a correct answer with unfinished reasoning trajectories. Overall, token efficiency\nresults under limited budgets substantiate the advantage of SWIREASONING in gaining accuracy\nmore efficiently as budgets tighten compared to baseline methods.\n\n4.4 EVALUATION WITH PASS@K ACCURACY\n\nIn addition to Pass@1 accuracy, we also measure Pass@k accuracy, where k \u2208 [1, 64] on Qwen3-\n8B. Fig. 5 shows that SWIREASONING reaches its maximal accuracy with significantly smaller k\nthan baselines. Define k\u22c6 as the smallest k achieving the method\u2019s peak. On AIME24, we observe\nk\u22c6 = 13 for SWIREASONING versus 46 for CoT (about 72% fewer samples), and on AIME25,\nk\u22c6 = 16 versus 22 (about 27% fewer samples). In addition to the faster growth of the curve than\nCoT, SWIREASONING also exhibits 1) a steeper initial slope at small k (higher \u201dper-sample yield\u201d),\nand 2) a higher eventual ceiling than Soft Thinking and greedy CoT, indicating better correctness\nand diversity simultaneously. Overall, Pass@k accuracy results indicate that SWIREASONING is\nparticularly attractive for budgeted evaluation settings where k cannot be large.\n\n4.5 ABLATION STUDIES\n\nSwitch Window Size. SWIREASONING uses dwell windows (Sec. 3.3) to enforce the model\nstays in a thinking block for at least W steps before switching to the other thinking mode. We\nconduct ablation studies on Qwen3-1.7B with a representative setting consisting of WE\u2192L \u2208\n{64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} and report Pass@1 accuracy on five benchmarks. Results in Tab. 3 demon-\nstrate that an intermediate window size of 512 consistently produces the best results.\n\nWhen window sizes are too small, LLMs are allowed to jump back to latent mode prematurely,\nbefore explicit reasoning has consolidated a coherent trajectory. This increases exposure to noisy\nsignals and harms final accuracy, especially on difficult tasks such as AIME24 and AIME25. On\n\n7\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\nFigure 4: Token efficiency comparisons. SWIREASONING achieves the highest token efficiency throughout all\ntoken budgets in 13 out of 15 evaluations, with an efficiency improvement of +84% over CoT on average.\n\nFigure 5: Pass@k accuracy (k \u2208 [1, 64]) evaluation with Qwen3-8B on AIME 2024 and 2025 benchmarks.\nSWIREASONING achieves maximum reasoning accuracies +50% earlier compared to CoT on average.\n\nthe contrary, when window sizes are too large, LLMs become sluggish to reenter latent exploration\nwhen confidence declines. A promising improvement direction is to make W adaptive to the model\u2019s\nreal-time density of effective reasoning.\n\nThinking-Related Signal Mixing. SWIREASONING uses \u03b10, \u03b20 \u2208 [0, 1] as the initial ratios for\nmixing thinking-related signals at switching instants (Sec. 3.3). We sweep \u03b10 and \u03b20 independently\nand report Pass@1 accuracies in Tab. 2.\n\n8\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\nTable 2: Ablations on \u03b10 and \u03b20 for signal mixing.

Performance\nrises sharply and peaks near \u03b20=0.7, which achieves the best average 62.88% and is either the best\nor the second-best on most datasets. A promising improvement direction is to make \u03b20 difficulty-\naware, so that it will be automatically adjusted based on problem difficulty.\n\nThe situation for the entrance bias \u03b10 is different. We observe a broad performance plateau for\n\u03b10 \u2208 [0.4, 0.9], with the highest average at \u03b10=1.0 (61.85%), however, only marginally higher than\nother values like \u03b10=0.9 (61.36%). Task-wise, problems with different levels of difficulty tend to\nhave various preferences over \u03b10. We expose \u03b10 to users for adjustment based on task difficulty.\nThe more detailed hyperparameters we adopted for the experiments are provided in Appendix B.3.\n\nMaximum Switch Count. We suppress over-\nthinking by bounding the number of mode\nswitches with a budget Cmax (Sec. 3.4), and re-\nducing Cmax leads to earlier convergence. In\nFig. 2 and Fig. 4, moving rightward on the\nx\u2013axis corresponds to smaller token budgets,\ni.e., smaller Cmax. We collect data points in\nthese figures by incrementing the value of Cmax\nfrom 1 until further increases in Cmax no longer\nalter generation results in most cases, i.e., max-\nimum accuracy is reached at saturation. De-\ntailed data points are provided in Appendix C.1.\n\nTable 3: Ablation on switch window size.

In summary,\nwith switch count control, a small number of confidence-aware blocks usually suffices for easy-to-\nmoderate problems, while difficult instances benefit more from allowing a few more switches before\nthe final answer.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper presents SWIREASONING, a training-free inference framework that integrates explicit\nchain-of-thought thinking with latent thinking through an entropy trends\u2013based controller. The\nframework is conceptually straightforward but empirically effective: when block-wise uncertainty\ndecreases, we collapse to a single explicit path to consolidate progress. When uncertainty rises and\nhas persisted for a minimal dwell window, we expand into latent space to explore more alternatives.\nComplementing this mode switch, a switch count controller caps the number of transitions, thereby\ncurbing overthinking while preserving prediction quality. Together, these two mechanisms yield\nconsistently improved Pareto frontiers for reasoning LLMs, effectively enhancing both maximum\naccuracy under unlimited budgets and token efficiency under limited budgets. Looking ahead, in-\ntegrating SWIREASONING with reinforcement learning\u2013based training may unlock even stronger\nreasoning capabilities.\n\n9\n\n\fSWIREASONING\n\n6 ETHICS STATEMENT\n\nThis work focuses on enhancing the reasoning accuracy and token efficiency of LLMs, which does\nnot raise safety concerns.

As such, it is plug-and-play during inference and can be layered\non top of the aforementioned techniques for multiplicative gains.\n\nC SUPPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENTS\n\nC.1 DETAILED EVALUATION RESULTS UNDER VARYING TOKEN BUDGETS\n\nWe provide detailed evaluation results of Qwen3-8B in Tab. 5-9, Qwen3-1.7B in Tab. 10-14, and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B in Tab. 15-19.\n\nTable 5: Evaluation results of Qwen3-8B on the GSM8K benchmark under varying token budgets.

We demonstrate in two\nproof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned\nknowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced\nmodifications using accurate natural language descriptions.",

Although they do not achieve state-of-\nthe-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific tasks. This\nraises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a system where\neach contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any individual model?\nExisting orchestration methods have primarily targeted frontier models (e.g., GPT-\n4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To address this gap, we\npropose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs. First, we introduce SLM-\nMUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively coordinates multiple SLMs.\nBuilding on this, we develop two optimization strategies: (i) a model selection\nsearch that identifies the most complementary SLMs from a given pool, and (ii)\ntest-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our approach delivers strong results:\nCompared to existing orchestration methods, our approach achieves up to 13.4%\nimprovement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0% on GSM8K. With just two\nSLMs, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and GSM8K, and\nmatches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical analyses to\nsubstantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we demonstrate that SLMs\ncan be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and efficient systems through the\nproposed approach.

While these models may underperform state-of-the-art frontier language models,\nwhich usually contain hundreds of billions to trillions of parameters, on any given query, they\noffer substantially lower inference costs, are more affordable to train and finetune, and allow edge\ndeployment due to their small size (Belcak et al., 2025). Meanwhile, frontier models have reached\ntrillion-parameter scales where further increases in size and training data yield diminishing returns.\nThis mirrors a well-known challenge in computer architecture two decades ago: when enlarging\nsingle CPU cores no longer delivered proportional performance gains, computer architects turned to\ndesigning multi-core processors, where multiple smaller cores working together enabled sustained\nimprovements. This parallel suggests that combining multiple SLMs could offer a promising\nalternative to scaling ever-larger frontier models.\n\nRecent works have explored orchestrating multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o), combining\nthem into one system to process an input collaboratively. Representative approaches include Mixture-\nof-Agent (Wang et al., 2024b), LLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023), and Multi-Agent Verification (Lifshitz\net al., 2025). These approaches share a key assumption: that models possess strong reasoning and\ndeliberation abilities, so that interaction through natural language can reliably correct mistakes.\nHowever, when applied to SLMs, this assumption no longer holds. Our study finds that such\ndiscussion-based orchestration often fails to improve performance for SLMs, and in some cases even\nreduces accuracy by over 5%. Instead of correcting mistakes, SLMs tend to fall into groupthink\nduring interaction, amplifying errors rather than mitigating them. The assumptions that language\n\n\u2217Equal contribution. Chenyu Wang(chenyu_wang@seas.harvard.edu) designed the methodology and con-\nducted experiments. Zishen Wan(zishenwan@gatech.edu) initiated and coordinated the project, secured collabo-\nrations, and provided guidance.\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fmodels can correct each other\u2019s answers behind existing orchestration methods do not hold for\nSLMs (Taubenfeld et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023).\n\nTo address this issue, we propose SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture for effectively orchestrating\nSLMs while avoiding explicit text exchanges between models. Our key insight is that SLM-MUX\nleverages complementary abilities from different models by selecting outputs based on confidence\nscores without any model training.\n\nAfter introducing SLM-MUX, another question\narises: which models should be orchestrated to-\ngether? Not all combinations are effective \u2013 if\none model is weaker across all dimensions, it\nprovides no benefit when paired with a stronger\none. In contrast, combining models with com-\nplementary strengths (e.g., one stronger in alge-\nbra, another in geometry) allows the system to\nsucceed where a single model would fail.\n\nTo address this, we develop a model selection\nsearch strategy for SLM-MUX, which system-\natically evaluates and identifies model subsets\nwith complementary strengths. By maximizing\nunion accuracy while penalizing overconfident\ncontradictions, the search procedure finds the\nmost suitable models for a given model budget.\n\nFigure 1: Head-to-Head Comparison of SLM-MUX\nwith Other Methods. SLM-MUX outperforms exist-\ning methods such as Self-Consistency (SC) (Wang et al.,\n2023), Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) (Wang et al., 2024b),\nLLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023), Multi-Agent Verification\n(MAV) (Lifshitz et al., 2025), and Agent Forest (Li et al.,\n2024). Results reported on MATH dataset with SLMs.\n\nIn addition, we explore compute scaling strate-\ngies for the selected model ensembles to further enhance performance. By adjusting the number of\nmodels and samples at inference time, we further boost performance and identify practical sweet\nspots in the accuracy-compute tradeoff.\n\nOur experiments demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmarks. By combining\nonly two SLMs, we achieve accuracy improvements of up to 6.7% on MATH, 5.7% on GPQA,\nand 4.8% on GSM8K, compared to the best-performing single SLMs in the system. Our method\nconsistently outperforms existing discussion-based approaches for SLMs, with gains of up to 13.4%\non MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0% on GSM8K. Most importantly, with just two SLMs, SLM-\nMUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and GSM, and matches its performance on MATH.\n\nFinally, we complement these empirical findings with theoretical and experimental analyses. Our\napproach shows superiority in multiple scenarios compared with previous methods (Figure 1).\n\n(i) We identify a fundamental limitation of existing\nOur main contributions are as follows:\norchestration methods: Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that existing discussion-\nbased methods, which show consistent improvements for frontier LLMs, actually harm performance\nwhen applied to SLMs. This counterintuitive finding challenges the assumption that orchestration\nmethods transfer across model scales and reveals the need for SLM-specific method. (ii) We propose\nSLM-MUX, a novel multi-model architecture designed specifically for SLMs that avoids the error\namplification problems of discussion-based methods. SLM-MUX achieves consistent gains across\nmultiple benchmarks (MATH, GPQA, GSM8K) and significantly outperforms existing discussion-\nbased methods by large margins (up to 11.6% on MATH). (iii) We develop principled optimization\nstrategies for the SLM-MUX, including model selection search that identifies complementary model\nselections and compute scaling strategies, further boosting performance while maintaining efficiency.\n\n2 RELATED WORK\n\nDiscussion-based Orchestration Methods. We use discussion-based orchestration to refer to orches-\ntration schemes where multiple LM instances exchange or evaluate natural-language messages\u2014such\nas proposing answers, critiquing or debating, verifying from different aspects, and finally aggregating\ninto one output. Representative approaches include Mixture-of-Agents (Wang et al., 2024b), which\nuses a dedicated LLM to aggregate outputs from several models; LLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023),\nwhere models critique and refine each other\u2019s reasoning; and Multi-Agent Verification (Lifshitz\net al., 2025), which assigns models to independently evaluate candidate solutions before selecting the\nfinal answer. These methods assume that participating models have sufficient reasoning ability to\n\n2\n\n50.052.555.057.560.062.5Accuracy (%)106107Token UsageLlamaMoADebateLlama-SCAgent ForestMAVSLM-Mux (Ours)Better\fFigure 2: Comparing SLM-Mux (Ours) with Existing LLM Orchestration Methods.

Prior evaluations have been conducted on frontier LLMs, while their\neffectiveness for SLMs remains unstudied.\n\nOptimization for Multi-LM Orchestration. Given these orchestration methods, some works study\nhow to further improve their performance\u2014e.g., how to select models to include, how to optimize\nprompts, or how to adapt the architecture for specific tasks (Chen et al., 2023a; Ong et al., 2025; Chen\net al., 2024). Prompt and workflow optimization methods (Khattab et al., 2023; Opsahl-Ong et al.,\n2024; Saad-Falcon et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025a) generally assume strong instruction-following\nability, which makes them less effective for smaller models.\n\nAnother line of work is model selection for orchestration (Chen et al., 2025; Poon et al., 2025). These\nmethods often assume that models with higher standalone accuracy will yield stronger orchestrations.\nHowever, such strategies overlook conflicts among models: overconfident but incorrect predictions\ncan dominate and suppress correct ones. Moreover, most selection criteria are not end-to-end\u2014they\nevaluate models individually without directly assessing the performance of the orchestration itself.\n\nTest-time Scaling Strategies. Test-time scaling refers to methods that improve performance by using\nadditional computation during inference without retraining (Snell et al., 2024; Muennighoff et al.,\n2025; Zhang et al., 2025b). For a single model, a common approach is self-consistency (Trad &\nChehab, 2025; Thirukovalluru et al., 2024; Chow et al., 2024), where multiple samples are drawn\nand the majority answer is selected; accuracy typically improves as the number of samples increases.\nExtending this idea to multiple models, Agent Forest (Li et al., 2024) asks each model to produce one\noutput and then applies majority voting over the pool of answers.\n\n3 METHODS\n\nIn this work, we set out to ask two critical questions: given a pool of available SLMs, how can we (i)\norchestrate their outputs to achieve the best overall performance, and (ii) select an effective subset of\nmodels that maximizes accuracy?\n\nTo answer question (i), we present the SLM-MUX (Section 3.1), a simple yet effective orchestration\nmethod. To answer question (ii), we propose model selection search (Section 3.2) that identifies\ncomplementary subsets from dozens of available SLMs. Finally, we explore compute scaling\nstrategies (Section 3.3) to further enhance the reasoning accuracy.\n\n3.1 SLM-MUX FOR ORCHESTRATING MULTIPLE SMALL LANGUAGE MODELS\n\nAt a high level, our intuition is that we do not need to let SLMs discuss with each other. Instead,\nwe can develop a simple rule-based method that estimates the confidence of each model\u2019s answer\nand then selects the final output from the model with the highest confidence. We term our method\nSLM-MUX, which operates in two phases.\n\nIndependent Generation Phase. For a given question, we first let each SLM independently generate\nmultiple candidate responses to the same query prompt with temperature > 0, producing a pool of\nsampled answers per model.\n\nConfidence Estimation Phase. We evaluate the confidence of each SLM\u2019s outputs by measuring\ntheir consistency across their own outputs. Intuitively, a model that places higher probability mass on\nthe correct answer will reproduce the same answer across samples, whereas an uncertain model will\nscatter its outputs. For instance, if SLM A produces three identical answers while model B produces\nthree different ones, the answer from model A is selected. This correlation between consistency\n\n3\n\nQuestionProposer 1Proposer 2Debater 1Debater 2Debater 1Debater 2Best AnswerQuestionProposer 1Proposer 2Aspect Verifier 1Best AnswerAspect Verifier 2Aspect Verifier 3Aspect Verifier 4QuestionProposer 1Proposer 2LLM AggregatorBest AnswerQuestionProposer 1Proposer 2Non-LLM Protocol AggregatorBest Answer(a) Mixture-of-Agents Paradigm(b) LLM-Debate Paradigm(c) Multi-Agent Verification Paradigm(d) SLM-Mux (Ours)\fFigure 3: Illustration of SLM-MUX Workflow.

(2) The most frequent answer from each SLM is selected, and its frequency in the answer\npool is used as the confidence score. (3) The answers with the highest confidence score are selected. (4) If\nmultiple answers share the same confidence score, the tie is broken by selecting the answer from the SLM with\nthe highest accuracy on the validation set.\n\nAlgorithm 1 SLM-MUX Working Flow\nInput: Models M1, . . . , Mn, query x, samples per model k, validation accuracies a1, . . . , an\nOutput: Final answer \u02c6y\n\nIndependent Generation: each model produces multiple candidate answers independently\n\n1: for i = 1, . . . , n do\n2:\n\n, . . . , y(k)\nSample k answers Yi = {y(1)\ni\n(cid:17)\n(cid:16)\ny(j)\nCompute fi(y) = 1\ni = y\nj=1 1\nk\ni = arg maxy fi(y) and set si = fi(y\u2217\nLet y\u2217\ni )\n\n(cid:80)k\n\ni } from Mi\n\n3:\n\n4:\n\nConfidence Estimation: measure self-consistency and break ties by validation accuracy\n\nI \u2217 = { i | si = Smax }\n\ni\u2217 \u2190 the unique index in I \u2217\n\n5: Smax = maxi si,\n6: if |I \u2217| = 1 then\n7:\n8: else\n9:\n10: return \u02c6y = y\u2217\ni\u2217\n\ni\u2217 \u2190 arg maxi\u2208I \u2217 ai\n\nand correctness is observed by previous papers. (Wang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024; Taubenfeld\net al., 2025; Chen et al., 2023b)\n\nIn cases where two SLMs are equally consistent but disagree, we use their validation accuracy as\na tie-breaker. Prior work has shown that consistency is strongly correlated with correctness, which\nprovides a rationale for this design.\n\nFor more details, Algorithm 1 summarizes the workflow step by step. Figure 3 provides a visual\nexample of the workflow. The evaluation of SLM-MUX is presented in Section 4.2.\n\n3.2 MODEL SELECTION SEARCH FOR SLM-MUX OPTIMIZATION\n\nAt a high level, the idea of model selection search is to identify complementarity among models. The\ngoal is not simply to add more models, but to bring new capabilities as we add models. To illustrate,\nFigure 4 illustrates this intuition: Qwen2.5-7B consistently outperforms Llama3.2-3B across all\nsubjects, so combining them offers no capability beyond what Qwen2.5-7B already provides. In\ncontrast, Mistral Small 24B and Qwen2.5-7B show complementary strengths\u2014one performs better\nin certain subjects while the other excels in different ones\u2014so pairing them leads to clear gains.\n\nWe frame model selection as a search on the validation set with two competing objectives. Our search\nobjective is formulated as follows:\n\nOur first objective is Union Accuracy, which reflects the overall accuracy of the system. The\nhigher the union accuracy is, the more questions a system can potentially answer. Formally, let\n\n4\n\nSLM1:SLM2:SLM3:Output 1:\u2026 , the final answer is (A)Output 2:\u2026 , the final answer is (A)Output 3: \u2026 , therefor the correct                   answer is (B)Output 1:\u2026 , the final answer is (A)Output 2:\u2026 , the correct choice is (B)Output 3:\u2026 , I think the best answer                   is (B)Output 1:\u2026 , the final answer is (A)Output 2:\u2026 , the correct choice is (B)Output 3:\u2026 , I think the best answer                   is (C)Confidence:67%Confidence:67%Confidence:33%Historical Accuracy:HighHistorical Accuracy:LowHistorical Accuracy:LowQuestion: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?(A) Superstring Theory(B) Classical Electrodynamics(C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)(D) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)Correct Answer: (A)Independent Generation PhaseReliability Estimation Phase\fM = {m1, . . . , mK} denote the set of candidate models and D the validation set. For each model\nmi \u2208 M, we record the subset of validation instances it solves correctly. Given a candidate subset\nS \u2286 M, the union accuracy is defined as\n1\n|D|\n\n1{\u2203 m \u2208 S : m(x) is correct}\n\nUnionAcc(S) =\n\n(cid:88)\n\nx\u2208D\n\nThe second objective is the Contradiction Penalty. It captures problematic cases where overconfident\nwrong answers suppress correct predictions from other models. Consider two SLMs answering the\nsame multiple-choice question three times: the first model consistently outputs \u201cA\u201d (correct), while\nthe second consistently outputs \u201cB\u201d (incorrect but confident). Since SLM-MUX selects based\non consistency, both models would appear equally confident, making it impossible to distinguish\nthe correct answer from the confident but wrong one. We define this penalty as the percentage of\nquestions where at least one model consistently gives the wrong answer while another provides the\ncorrect answer:\n\nContradiction(S) =\n\n1\n|D|\n\n(cid:88)\n\nx\u2208D\n\n(cid:40)\n1\n\n\u2203 m1 \u2208 S : m1(x) consistently wrong,\n\u2203 m2 \u2208 S : m2(x) correct\n\n(cid:41)\n\nThe final objective balances these competing factors:\n\nO(S) = Acc(S) \u2212 \u03bb \u00b7 Contradiction(S),\nWhere \u03bb is a hyperparameter. Since the number of candidate models is not very large, we perform\nan exhaustive search. We present visualization of the two search objectives and evaluation of the\nsearched model selection in Section 4.3.\n\n3.3 COMPUTE SCALING STRATEGIES\n\nNext, we empirically investigate two\ndimensions of test-time scaling to fur-\nther enhance the performance of our\nSLM-MUX with selected models.\n\nAdding More Participating Model\nTypes: As we scale the model\nparticipating model types used in the\nsystem by adding more SLMs with\ncomplementary strengths, we expect\nthe overall accuracy to improve. For\neach budgeted number of models,\nwe use the search method proposed\nin Section 3.2 to identify the best\nselection from the pool.\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of Model Choices. Accuracy on 7 subjects\nfor two model selection settings on MATH dataset. Subjects are\ndenoted as: A = Prealgebra, B = Algebra, C = Intermediate Algebra,\nD = Number Theory, E = Counting & Probability, F = Geometry, G\n= Precalculus.\n\nDrawing More Samples per Model:\nFor a fixed model selection, we can\nincrease the compute budget by scaling the number of samples drawn by each model. Since confidence\nis evaluated by counting the frequency of majority answers, adding more samples per model is\nexpected to provide a more accurate confidence estimate.\n\nThese two compute scaling dimensions are evaluated in Section 4.4.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTS\n\nIn our experiments, we first demonstrate the fundamental limitations of existing discussion-based\norchestration methods when applied to SLMs (Section 4.1). We then evaluate the proposed SLM-\nMUX in Section 4.2. In Section 4.3, we access our proposed search strategy. Finally, in Section 4.4,\nwe examine the compute scaling strategies.\n\n4.1 EXISTING DISCUSSION-BASED ORCHESTRATION METHODS HARM SLM PERFORMANCE\n\nTo understand whether orchestration methods developed for frontier LLMs are suitable for SLMs, we\nconduct a systematic comparison across model scales. We evaluate three prominent discussion-based\nmethods\u2014LLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023), Mixture-of-Agents (Wang et al., 2024b), and Multi-Agent\nVerification (Lifshitz et al., 2025) \u2014using identical experimental settings on both SLMs (Llama 3.1\n\n5\n\nABCDEFG0.20.40.60.81.0Qwen 2.5 7BLlama 3.2 3BABCDEFG0.20.40.60.81.0Qwen 2.5 7BMistral Small 24B\f8B (Jiang et al., 2024), Mistral 8\u00d77B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Gemma 2 27B) and frontier LLMs\n(DeepSeek V3 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google Cloud, 2025), GPT-4o (OpenAI\net al., 2024)). Evaluation is conducted on MATH and GPQA datasets using original implementations\nand prompts.\n\nResults. As shown in Figure 5, discussion-based methods generally outperform the single best-\nperforming models in the frontier LLM group, achieving up to a 2% increase in accuracy. However,\nwhen applied to SLMs, these discussion-based methods fail to outperform the best single model in\nthe orchestration, and even incur accuracy drops of up to 5.5%. This performance gap is observed\nacross all three methods and both benchmarks.\n\nTo understand this counterintuitive result, we analyze SLM behavior in discussion settings. We find\nthat discussion-based methods amplify rather than correct errors in SLMs due to a key limitations:\nSLMs tend to exhibit groupthink, reinforcing incorrect reasoning during discussions rather than\ncorrecting mistakes. Additional analysis and demonstration is provided in the Appendix C.\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of discussion-based orchestration when invoking SLMs and LLMs. We compare\nthree orchestration methods (Mixture-of-Agents, LLM-Debate, and Verification) using (a) SLMs (Llama 3.1 8B,\nMistral 8\u00d77B, Gemma 2 27B) and (b) frontier LLMs (DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o) on the MATH\nand GPQA datasets. The baseline (Single-Model Max) reflects the best performance of individual models. A\norchestration is considered successful if it surpasses Single-Model Max.\n\n4.2 SLM-MUX ACHIEVES SLM ORCHESTRATION WHERE EXISTING METHODS FAIL\n\nTo evaluate whether our proposed SLM-MUX can suc-\ncessfully orchestrate SLMs, we test it against the same\nbaselines from Section 4.1. We use Mistral 8\u00d77B, LLaMA\n3.1 8B, and Gemma 2 27B (Team et al., 2024) as base\nmodels. We implement the SLM-MUX as follows. First,\nwe generate three rounds of answers with a temperature\nof 0.3. Next, we compute a confidence score by count-\ning how often the most common answer appears across\nthese rounds. The final answer for each model is chosen\nas the most frequent one; in the case of a tie, we select\nthe answer from the model with the highest validation\naccuracy. We evaluate three types of baselines. First, we\nmeasure the accuracies of individual models and report the\nbest-performing ones. Next, for comparison with existing\ndiscussion-based methods, we include LLM-Debate (Du et al., 2023), Mixture-of-Agents (Wang et al.,\n2024b), and Multi-Agent Verification (Lifshitz et al., 2025). We follow the original workflow designs\nand prompts described in their papers. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets:\nMATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021).\n\nFigure 6: Final Output Attribution. We\nreport the percentage of outputs contributed\nby each model on the MATH dataset for our\nSLM-MUX. These results are from the same\nrun as in Table 1.\n\nResults. Table 1 summarizes the results. In our experiments, we find that for SLMs, existing\norchestration methods do not consistently outperform the strongest individual base models or\nself-consistency approaches. In contrast, our SLM-MUX generally achieves an accuracy gain.\nCompared with other approaches, our method yields up to a 13.4% improvement on MATH, up to\n8.8% on GPQA, and up to 7.0% on GSM8K. These results demonstrate that the SLM-MUX itself\nprovides a clear advantage over alternative orchestration approaches at the architectural level.\n\n6\n\n30405060708090Accuracy (%)MATHGPQA56.851.451.648.438.833.336.935.430405060708090Accuracy (%)MATHGPQA90.488.890.891.663.658.665.664.2Single Model MaxMixture-of-AgentsLLM-DebateMulti-Agent Verification(a) Small-Scale Model Composition(b) Large-Scale Model Composition21.2%38.8%38.0%2.0%No DisagreementLlama 3.1 8BGemma-2 27BMixtral-8x7B\fTo better illustrate our proposed SLM-MUX, we plot the output attribution for the MATH experiment\n(Table 1) in Figure 6.

We plot\nthe search objectives as the number of models (K) increases from 2 to 5 across three benchmarks. The green line\ndenotes the union accuracy across models, the grey area indicates the contradiction penalty, and the blue line\nrepresents the overall search objective score.\n\nTo examine whether model selection search benefits SLM-MUX, we construct a validation set\nof 500 questions sampled from the training splits of MATH, GPQA, and GSM8K. The candidate\npool consists of five SLMs: Gemma 2 27B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral Small 24B (Mistral AI, 2025),\nMixtral 8\u00d77B, and Qwen2.5 7B (Qwen et al., 2025). For each question, we collect three independent\ngenerations per model with temperature 0.5, repeating this process three times to obtain stable\naccuracy estimates. The search procedure considers orchestrations with K = 2 to 5 models and is\nguided by an objective function mentioned in Section 3, with hyperparameter \u03bb = 1. The behavior of\nthis objective is illustrated in Figure 7, showing the trade-off as K increases. For simplicity, we select\ntwo representative two-model combinations from the search results for evaluation on the test set.\n\nResults. Table 2 summarizes the outcome of the search. The table lists the top-performing two-model\ncombinations identified on the validation set, along with their evaluation on the held-out test set.\nAcross benchmarks, these optimized orchestrations yield consistent improvements over the strongest\nindividual models: accuracy increases by 4.5% on MATH, 4.4% on GPQA, and 4.3% on GSM8K.\nThis contrasts with Section 4.2, where naive three-model combinations provide little to no benefit\non GPQA. Figure 7 further illustrates the underlying trade-off: while union accuracy rises with\nadditional models, the contradiction penalty also grows, emphasizing that effective orchestration\nrequires balancing these competing factors rather than simply enlarging the orchestration size.\n\n4.4 COMPUTE SCALING STRATEGIES REVEAL OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION\n\nTo evaluate the \u201cAdding More Participating Model Types\" dimension of compute scaling, we assess\nhow performance changes as the number of models in the orchestration increases. For each number\nof models from 2 to 5, we first apply the search method from Section 3.2 to identify the optimal\nmodel selection from our pool. We then evaluate SLM-MUX with selected models on the validation\nset. Figure 9 plots the resulting mean accuracy (blue line, left y-axis) for each value of K. To illustrate\nthe theoretical performance ceiling of each ensemble, we also plot the union accuracy (grey line,\nright y-axis), defined as the percentage of questions solved by at least one model in the group.\n\n7\n\n12345K0.10.00.10.20.30.40.5Objective ValueSearch Objectives for GPQAScoreUnion AccuracyContradiction Penalty12345K0.800.820.840.860.880.90Objective ValueSearch Objectives for GSM8KScoreUnion AccuracyContradiction Penalty12345K0.620.640.660.680.70Objective ValueSearch Objectives for MATHScoreUnion AccuracyContradiction Penalty\fBenchmark\n\nGroup\n\nModel Selection\n\nBest Single\n(Acc. %)\n\nComposed\n(Acc. %)\n\n\u2206\n(Gain)\n\nMATH\n\nGPQA\n\nGSM8K\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nMistral Small 24B\nQwen2.5 7B\n\nQwen2.5 7B\nLlama 3.1 8B\n\nGemma 2 27B\nMistral Small 24B\n\nLlama 3.1 8B\nMistral Small 24B\n\nMistral Small 24B\nQwen2.5 7B\n\nLlama 3.1 8B\nMixtral 8\u00d77B\n\n75.5 \u00b1 1.5\n\n80.0 \u00b1 0.7\n\n75.5 \u00b1 1.5\n\n77.7 \u00b1 0.7\n\n45.1 \u00b1 2.8\n\n49.5 \u00b1 1.8\n\n45.1 \u00b1 2.8\n\n48.8 \u00b1 0.8\n\n88.5 \u00b1 0.7\n\n92.8 \u00b1 0.6\n\n80.8 \u00b1 2.1\n\n85.2 \u00b1 0.7\n\n+4.5\n\n+2.2\n\n+4.4\n\n+3.6\n\n+4.3\n\n+4.4\n\nTable 2: Model Selection Search and Evaluation Results.

We compare SLM-MUX and Agent Forest in two\nsettings: (1) with 2 samples per model (Samples=2), and (2) using the best accuracy found during scaling for\neach method (Samples=best). In the second setting, the number of samples per model may vary.\n\nFor the \u201cDrawing More Samples per Model\u201d dimension, we reuse the two groups of models listed\nin Table 2. We vary the number of samples per model from 2 to 9 and report the mean accuracy of\nSLM-MUX over three runs for each sample budget. The results are presented in Figure 8, along\nwith a baseline, Agent Forest (Li et al., 2024), for comparison. To ensure fairness, Agent Forest\nis reproduced using the same models from Group 2. We report the best accuracy achieved by the\nSLM-MUX when scaling with Samples per Model and compare it to the accuracy of the single best\nmodel in the orchestration, as shown in Table 2.\n\nResults. The effect of \u201cAdding More Participating Model Types\u201d varies substantially across bench-\nmarks. On GPQA, accuracy peaks when combining two models and declines thereafter. On GSM8K,\naccuracy quickly saturates at two models without further gains. In contrast, on MATH, accuracy\ncontinues to improve as additional models are included. Despite these differences, the union accuracy\nof model orchestration consistently increases with more models, emphasizing the role of output\ncontradictions among models, as elaborated in Section 3.2.\n\n\u201cDrawing More Samples per Model\u201d yields more consistent improvements across benchmarks.\nMoreover, under this setting, our SLM-MUX systematically outperforms Agent Forest, with the\nlargest margin observed on GPQA, where single-model accuracy is lowest.\n\nBenchmark\n\nGroup 1\n\nGroup 2\n\nQwen-2.5 72B Acc. %\n\nAcc. %\n\n\u2206 (Gain)\n\nAcc. %\n\n\u2206 (Gain)\n\nMATH\nGPQA\nGSM8K\n\n81.9 \u00b1 0.2\n49.9 \u00b1 1.8\n93.7 \u00b1 0.2\n\n+6.4\n+4.8\n+5.2\n\n79.5 \u00b1 0.4\n48.7 \u00b1 1.2\n86.5 \u00b1 0.8\n\n+4.0\n+3.6\n+5.7\n\n82.3 \u00b1 0.5\n44.9 \u00b1 0.5\n90.4 \u00b1 0.3\n\nTable 4: Best Accuracy after Sample Scaling beats Larger Model.

For reference, we also include the performance of the large model\nQwen-2.5 72B, showing that our composed small models can outperform it on GPQA and GSM8K.\n\n5 DISCUSSION\n\nMathematical Analysis.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 8: Drawing More Samples per Model Improves Accuracy. We report mean accuracy of SLM-MUX\nas the number of samples per model increases from 2 to 9 across three benchmarks. Group 1 and Group 2 are\nfrom Table 2. We also plotted the mean accuracy of Agent Forest (Li et al., 2024) in grey line.\n\nFigure 9: Adding More Participating Models Affects Accuracy Differently. We report the mean accuracy\n(blue line) of the optimal SLM-MUX obtained when using 2 to 5 models across three benchmarks. We also\nreport the union accuracy (grey line), defined in Section 3.2. The blue line (Mean Accuracy) is plotted against\nthe left-hand Y-axis. The grey line (Union Accuracy) is plotted against the right-hand Y-axis.\n\nTo explain our good performance, we note a limitation of self-consistency methods. Suppose a model\nhas probability p of answering a question correctly. When self-consistency samples N responses,\nthe probability of obtaining the correct answer after aggregation follows a binomial distribution.\n(cid:18)N\nk\n\npk(1 \u2212 p)N \u2212k, X \u223c Binomial(N, p)\n\nA(N, p) = Pr (cid:0)X \u2265 (cid:6) N\n\n(cid:7)(cid:1) =\n\nN\n(cid:88)\n\n(cid:19)\n\n2\n\nk=\u2308N/2\u2309\n\nA(N, p) exceeds p only when p > 0.5, meaning self-consistency is effective only in this regime.\nWhen p < 0.5, however, self-consistency can actually lower overall accuracy. For any dataset,\nwe can conceptually divide examples into three types of questions. Type 1 includes cases where\np = 100%, so the LLM always answers correctly. Type 2 covers cases where p > 50%, meaning\nthe model is more likely than not to be correct. Type 3 includes cases where p < 50%, where the\nmodel is more likely to be wrong. The overall effect of self-consistency is then the improvement\nfrom Type 2, offset by the degradation from Type 3. Improvement occurs only when the dataset\ncontains a sufficiently large proportion of Type 2 questions.\n\nFor the SLM-MUX, we select the output from the most confident model, so the accuracy can be\napproximated as A(N, pmax), where pmax is the highest probability among the three models. By\nincreasing pmax, we effectively enlarge the proportion of Type 2 questions, leading to higher overall\naccuracy. For the Agent Forest approach, answers are drawn evenly from all models, so its accuracy\ncan be approximated as A(N, \u00afp), where \u00afp is the average probability across models. This generally\nresults in lower accuracy than SLM-MUX.\n\nLimitation and Future Work. The SLM-MUX framework has two main limitations. First, its design\nis static and does not adapt to specific questions. For every query, it uses a fixed group of models that\nare pre-selected through exhaustive search \u2013 a method that is slow and costly when there are many\nmodels to choose from. When models are tied, the framework uses their past accuracy on a validation\nset to decide, which is also a fixed, non-adaptive rule. Second, the way the framework measures\nmodel confidence is simple. It relies only on self-consistency \u2013 how often a model produces the same\nanswer. This can be a problem because a model can be very consistent while still being incorrect.\n\nConclusion. This work demonstrates that orchestration methods designed for frontier models\nparadoxically degrade the performance of SLMs by amplifying errors. To address this, we propose\nSLM-MUX, a framework that avoids inter-model discussion, instead selecting the most reliable\n\n9\n\n23456789Samples per Model4041424344454647484950Accuracy (%)Drawing More Samples per Model for GPQAGroup 1Group 2Agent Forest23456789Samples per Model788082848688909294Accuracy (%)Drawing More Samples per Model for GSM8KGroup 1Group 2Agent Forest23456789Samples per Model7273747576777879808182Accuracy (%)Drawing More Samples per Model for MATHGroup 1Group 2Agent Forest12345Number of Participating Models46474849505152Accuracy (%)Adding More Participating Models for GPQAAccuracyUnion12345Number of Participating Models8990919293Accuracy (%)Adding More Participating Models for GSM8KAccuracyUnion12345Number of Participating Models7273747576777879Accuracy (%)Adding More Participating Models for MATHAccuracyUnion48566472Union Accuracy (%)9092949698Union Accuracy (%)7275788184Union Accuracy (%)\foutput based on each model\u2019s self-consistency. We further introduce a model selection search\nalgorithm to find complementary model combinations. Experiments show our method not only\nsubstantially outperforms existing strategies but also enables an ensemble of just two SLMs to\nsurpass the much larger Qwen-2.5 72B model on key reasoning benchmarks. In summary, our work\nvalidates that intelligently orchestrating multiple efficient models\u2014a \"multi-core\" approach\u2014is a\nhighly promising alternative to endlessly scaling monolithic models on the path toward more capable\nAI systems.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Prof. Tom Griffiths (Princeton University) for insightful technical discussions, which\ninspired our early exploration of our method.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nLoubna Ben Allal, Anton Lozhkov, Elie Bakouch, Gabriel Mart\u00edn Bl\u00e1zquez, Guilherme Penedo,\nLewis Tunstall, Andr\u00e9s Marafioti, Hynek Kydl\u00ed\u02c7cek, Agust\u00edn Piqueres Lajar\u00edn, Vaibhav Srivastav,\net al.

Section B presents additional visual examples illustrating\nthe workflow and effectiveness of the SLM-MUX method across the MATH, GPQA, and GSM8K\ndatasets. Section C provides a detailed analysis of SLM failures in discussion-based orchestration\nmethods, drawing on experiment logs to highlight common failure patterns. Section D reports the\naccuracy of individual models used in our experiments. Finally, Section E provides the licensing\ndetails for the datasets.\n\nA LLM USAGE STATEMENT\n\nWe used Cursor for coding. Large language models (LLMs) were employed to help polish drafts\nwritten by humans, and to assist in searching for related papers. The final choice of related work\nincluded in this paper was made entirely by the human authors after careful screening. LLMs were\nalso used for proofreading and for providing suggestions.\n\nB ADDITIONAL VISUAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF SLM-MUX\n\nTo more effectively illustrate the workflow of our proposed composition method, we select several\nrepresentative examples from the logs. We demonstrate them in Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12.\n\nSLM-MUX surpasses majority voting in scenarios with initial disagreement among models..\nAs illustrated by Figure 10, during the independent generation phase, Gemma-2-27B is the sole\nmodel to provide the correct answer. Hence, majority voting applied directly would fail to select the\ncorrect author.\n\nFigure 10: An illustration of the SLM-MUX method applied to the MATH dataset. In the independent\ngeneration phase, three models are used: LLaMA-3.1-8B (denoted as Llama), Gemma-2-27B (denoted as\nGemma), and Mixtral-8\u00d77B (denoted as Mixtral). Because the three models provide different answers at first,\nso each model is invoked two more times. Gemma obtains the highest confidence score and is therefore selected\nas the final output.\n\nC DETAILED ANALYSIS OF SLM FAILURES IN DISCUSSION-BASED\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe analyze the experiment logs of LLM-Debate using small language models (SLMs) in Section 4.1.\nAmong 500 debate problems, 242 resulted in failure (48.4%). For each of the 242 failed debates, we\nfirst used an analyzer LLM to produce a process-focused failure analysis. We then used a separate\nlabeling LLM to classify whether each failed debate was due to groupthink.\n\nThe labeling results are shown in Table 5:\n\nThese results reinforce our claim that groupthink is a major failure mode in SLM-based LLM-debate.\n\nWe provide the exact prompts used by (i) the analyzer LLM to generate the 242 failure analyses\n(Figure 13) and (ii) the groupthink labeler LLM to classify groupthink (Figure 14). Placeholders such\nas {problem} indicate runtime substitutions by our code.\n\n17\n\nLlama:Gemma:Mixtral:Output 1:To convert the decimal number, \u2026, 4220Output 2:To express 555 in base, \u2026, 4210Output 3: To express 555 in base 5, \u2026, 100Output 1:Here's how to convert 555, \u2026, 4210Output 2:Here's how to convert 555, \u2026, 4210Output 3:Here's how to convert 555 from, .., 4210Output 1:First, we need to perform repeated, \u2026, 1Output 2:To express the decimal number, \u2026, 4121Output 3:First, we need to perform repeated, \u2026, 1Confidence:33%Confidence:100%Confidence:67%Historical Accuracy:49%Historical Accuracy:57%Historical Accuracy:32%Question: Express 555 in base 5.Correct Answer: 4210Independent Generation PhaseReliability Estimation Phase\fFigure 11: An illustration of the SLM-MUX method applied to the GSM8K dataset. In the independent\ngeneration phase, different models produce different answers. However, when we invoke each model multiple\ntimes, we observe that Llama and Mixtral only yield correct answers approximately one-third of the time. In\ncontrast, Gemma demonstrates stable performance.\n\nFigure 12: An illustration of the SLM-MUX method applied to the GPQA dataset. During the independent\ngeneration phase, Gemma and Mixtral obtain the same confidence score. However, considering historical\naccuracy, Mixtral ranks higher. Therefore, Mixtral\u2019s answer is selected as the final output.\n\nD ACCURACY OF SINGLE LLMS\n\nWe evaluated the accuracy of single model accuracy under the condition of temperature equal to zero.\nThe results are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.\n\nE LICENSES FOR DATASETS\n\nThe MATH dataset is licensed under the MIT License.\nThe GPQA dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY\n4.0) License.\nThe GSM8K dataset is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n18\n\nLlama:Gemma:Mixtral:Output 1:To solve this problem, \u2026 ,750Output 2:To solve this problem, \u2026 , 50Output 3: Let's break down the problem step, \u2026, 25Output 1:Here's how to solve the problem, \u2026 ,50Output 2:Here's how to solve the problem, \u2026 ,50Output 3:Here's how to solve the problem, \u2026 ,50Output 1:First, let's determine how, \u2026, 150Output 2:First, let's determine how, \u2026, 25Output 3:First, let's determine how, \u2026, 50Confidence:33%Confidence:100%Confidence:33%Historical Accuracy:84%Historical Accuracy:82%Historical Accuracy:64%Question: Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.

To address this issue, we propose\nTolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding\nstrategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens.

This design enables previously accepted\ntokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more\nreliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard\nbenchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.\nExperiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the\nbaselines under the same computational budget.

Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for\nmodel deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single\nsampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from stochas-\ntic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference optimiza-\ntion for LRMs through the lens of the bias\u2013variance trade-off and propose Bias\u2013\nVariance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple, drop-in method\nthat mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based estimator and a\nlow-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling reasoning trace genera-\ntion. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces trace-induced variance for any\nnontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form choice of the mixing weight that min-\nimizes mean-squared error relative to the true marginal gradient, and under stan-\ndard smoothness and step-size conditions, tightens classical convergence bounds\nfor stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the\nbest baseline by up to 7.8 points on AlpacaEval 2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard.\nDespite being trained only on general conversational data, BVPO also boosts rea-\nsoning performance for base models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math\nreasoning benchmarks. These results identify variance from trace sampling as a\nkey bottleneck and demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias\u2013variance trade-\noff yields more stable training and stronger overall performance.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLarge reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-o1, scale test-time\ncompute by generating intermediate reasoning traces before producing a final answer (Snell et al.,\n2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; OpenAI et al., 2024). This explicit de-\nliberation drives large gains on multi-step and mathematically intensive tasks, and reinforcement\nlearning with verifiable rewards further improves such capability (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI\net al., 2025; Ahmadian et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025). While alignment with human preference is\na prerequisite for deployment, the alignment of LRMs remains largely unexplored. To the best of\nour knowledge, there is no systematic treatment of aligning LRMs with human preferences; public\ndiscussion is sparse and limited to brief remarks in technical reports accompanying foundational\nLRMs (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; OpenAI et al., 2024). Existing alignment pipelines\u2014from RLHF\n(Ouyang et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2020; Schulman et al., 2017) to direct preference optimization\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023b) and its variants (Park et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2024; Ethayarajh et al.,\n2024; Zhu et al., 2025)\u2014were developed for conventional LLMs that do not externalize lengthy rea-\nsoning traces. When applied naively to LRMs, these methods inherit a unique source of instability:\ntrace-induced gradient variance.\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint.\n\nTo explain this, we study preference optimization for LRMs under the trace\u2013answer factorization\n\u03c0\u03b8(r, y | x) = \u03c0\u03b8(r | x) \u03c0\u03b8(y | x, r), where the model first generates a reasoning trace r and then\nproduces the final answer y. The statistically correct preference optimization objective compares\nmarginal answer probabilities \u03c0\u03b8(y | x) = (cid:80)\nr \u03c0\u03b8(r, y | x), so that all possible traces leading to the\nsame answer are included. However, this sum spans an exponentially large set of traces, making it\ncomputationally infeasible. In practice, it is typically replaced with a single sampled trace, yielding\na trace-based preference loss and its gradient, the trace-based gradient gt (DeepSeek-AI et al.,\n2025). This estimator is easy to compute but highly noisy: long and variable traces produce large\nfluctuations in joint log-probabilities, which hinder stable optimization.\n\nWe propose Bias\u2013Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO) to address the high vari-\nance inherent in this trace-based training. BVPO augments the standard trace-based gradient gt with\nan empty-trace gradient ge, computed by conditioning the policy on an empty trace. ge is deter-\nministic with respect to trace sampling and hence has low variance relative to the ideal marginal\ngradient. BVPO then forms a convex combination, gc(\u03b1) = \u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge, designed to be opti-\nmal with respect to the Mean Squared Error (MSE) with respect to the ideal marginal gradient gm.\nCrucially, MSE can be decomposed into squared bias and variance, providing a principled metric for\nstrategically balancing the high-variance gt with the low-variance ge. Our analysis guarantees this\ncombined estimator gc has a lower variance and a strictly better MSE than either component alone\nfor any nontrivial mixture. The resulting MSE reduction directly tightens the SGD convergence\nbound, providing a principled link between statistical optimality and improved training stability.\n\nExtensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2 (Li et al., 2023) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2025) show that\nBVPO consistently outperforms the best baseline, with gains of up to 7.8 points on AlpacaEval 2\nand 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Because alignment with human preference is typically the final stage\nbefore deployment, we also examine whether LRMs\u2019 reasoning ability is preserved after alignment.\nDespite being trained exclusively on general conversational data, BVPO does not degrade, and in\nfact improves reasoning, raising the base model\u2019s average performance across six math reasoning\nbenchmarks by up to 4.0 points, including AIME24/25 (Li et al., 2024), AMC (Li et al., 2024),\nOlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), and MATH-500 (Hendrycks\net al., 2021). These results indicate that BVPO not only stabilizes the alignment process but also\nenhances reasoning capabilities. Our key contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We identify high gradient variance in aligning LRMs due to stochastic reasoning trace sam-\npling, and propose BVPO, which linearly combines trace-based and low-variance empty-\ntrace gradient estimators, explicitly optimizing the bias\u2013variance trade-off via MSE.\n\n\u2022 We prove that BVPO\u2019s combined gradient estimator reduces conditional variance induced\nby trace sampling, derive an MSE-optimal mixing coefficient with domination guarantees,\nand connect these results to tighter SGD convergence bounds.\n\n\u2022 Extensive experiments demonstrate that BVPO achieves gains over the best baseline by up\nto 6.8 points on Arena-Hard and 7.8 points on AlpacaEval 2. Although trained exclusively\non general conversational data, BVPO nevertheless substantially improves the average per-\nformance of the base model on six math reasoning benchmarks by up to 4.0 points.\n\n2 RELATED WORK\n\nLarge Reasoning Models. Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek-AI\net al., 2025), Gemini 2.5 (Comanici et al., 2025), and GPT-o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024) mark a new\nfrontier in LLM development. Unlike conventional LLMs, LRMs leverage test-time scaling (Snell\net al., 2025), generating explicit reasoning traces before producing final answers. This mechanism\nsubstantially improves performance on complex, multi-step problems (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025;\nShao et al., 2024). Recent efforts further enhance LRMs\u2019 reasoning ability through reinforcement\nlearning with verifiable rewards, especially on mathematically intensive tasks (Shao et al., 2024;\nDeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Ahmadian et al., 2024; Zeng et al., 2025). In contrast, to the best of our\nknowledge, there is no systematic study of aligning LRMs with human preferences, a prerequisite for\nreal-world deployment. Existing discussions are sparse and confined to brief subsections in technical\nreports of foundation LRMs (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Our work fills this gap by systematically\nanalyzing the alignment challenges unique to LRMs\u2014most notably the high variance induced by\nlong, stochastic reasoning traces, and introducing a principled algorithm to address them.\n\n2\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed-\nback (RLHF) is a foundational approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human\npreferences (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2020; Schulman et al., 2017). Recent efforts focus on\nbypassing explicit reward model training. A prominent approach is Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023b), which formulates an explicit loss corresponding to the PPO-induced\nreward. This enables direct fine-tuning without training a reward model. DPO has demonstrated\nstability and efficiency across diverse applications (Ivison et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024; Miao et al.,\n2024). Several extensions refine this framework further: R-DPO (Park et al., 2024) mitigates sen-\nsitivity to sequence length, SimPO (Meng et al., 2024) better aligns the objective with the sam-\npling distribution and eliminates the reference model, KTO (Ethayarajh et al., 2024) generalizes\npreference optimization beyond pairwise comparisons, and TGDPO (Zhu et al., 2025) incorporates\ntoken-level reward guidance. However, these methods are developed for conventional LLMs that di-\nrectly produce final answers. When naively applied to LRMs, which externalize lengthy reasoning\ntraces that reflect the model\u2019s internal deliberation and trial-and-error, they face a unique challenge:\nhigh gradient variance originating from stochastic trace sampling and large fluctuations in joint log-\nprobabilities. To address this, we propose BVPO, a principled preference optimization method that\noptimizes bias\u2013variance trade-off, yielding significantly stronger alignment while preserving and\neven enhancing reasoning performance in math reasoning tasks.\n\n3 PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION FOR LRMS\n\nThis section formalizes the problem of aligning Large Reasoning Models with human preferences\nusing preference optimization. We first review the standard DPO objective, highlighting its limita-\ntions when applied to LRMs, and then introduce our proposed method.\n\n3.1 PRELIMINARIES\n\nLarge Reasoning Models. An LRM is modeled as a policy \u03c0\u03b8 parameterized by \u03b8. Given a prompt\nx, the model first generates an intermediate reasoning trace r and then produces a final answer y.\nThis sequential process defines a probability distribution over the complete trajectory (r, y), which\nfactorizes as: \u03c0\u03b8(r, y | x) = \u03c0\u03b8(r | x) \u03c0\u03b8(y | x, r). The marginal probability of the final answer y is\nobtained by summing over all possible reasoning traces: \u03c0\u03b8(y | x) = (cid:80)\n\nr \u03c0\u03b8(r, y | x).\n\nDirect Preference Optimization. DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023b) aligns language models with hu-\nman preferences by bypassing the explicit reward-modeling stage of traditional RLHF. The key\ninsight is to analytically derive a loss from the Bradley-Terry preference model (Bradley & Terry,\n1952), which defines the probability that a response y+ is preferred over y\u2212 as:\n\np(y+ \u227b y\u2212 | x) = \u03c3 (cid:0)r(x, y+) \u2212 r(x, y\u2212)(cid:1) ,\n\nwhere \u03c3(\u00b7) is the sigmoid function and r(x, y) is a latent reward function. DPO defines this reward\nin terms of the model policy \u03c0\u03b8 and a fixed reference policy \u03c0ref:\n\nr(x, y) = \u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(y | x)\n\u03c0ref(y | x)\n\n.\n\nHere, \u03b2 is a temperature parameter that scales the reward difference. Substituting this reward def-\ninition into the preference model and maximizing the log-likelihood for a dataset D of preference\ntuples (x, y+, y\u2212) yields the DPO loss:\n\nLDPO(\u03c0\u03b8) = \u2212E(x,y+,y\u2212)\u223cD\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog \u03c3\n\n\u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(y+ | x)\n\u03c0ref(y+ | x)\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(y\u2212 | x)\n\u03c0ref(y\u2212 | x)\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n3.2 DPO FOR LRMS: IDEAL VS. PRACTICAL OBJECTIVES\n\nApplying the standard DPO framework to LRMs requires adapting its objective to account for rea-\nsoning traces. This section formalizes this challenge by contrasting the theoretically ideal objective\nwith its standard, practical approximation.\n\n3\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nIdeal Objective: The Marginal Preference Loss Lm. The ideal objective for aligning an LRM\napplies the DPO loss to the marginal probabilities of the final answers. This marginal preference\nloss compares the log-probability ratios of the preferred output y+ and dispreferred output y\u2212 rela-\ntive to a reference policy \u03c0ref:\n\nLm(\u03b8) = \u2212E(x,y+,y\u2212)\u223cD\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog \u03c3\n\n\u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(y+ | x)\n\u03c0ref(y+ | x)\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(y\u2212 | x)\n\u03c0ref(y\u2212 | x)\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\nwhere the marginal probability is \u03c0\u03b8(y | x) = (cid:80)\nr \u03c0\u03b8(r, y | x). This loss is statistically optimal as it\ndirectly models the true preference over final answers. However, computing the marginal probability\nrequires summing over an exponentially large space of possible reasoning traces, rendering this loss\ncomputationally intractable.\n\nPractical Proxy: The Trace-Based Loss Lt. The standard approach to create a tractable approxi-\nmation of marginal probabilities for LRMs is to use a single-sample Monte Carlo estimate based on\nsampled trajectories (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). In the case of Lm(\u03b8), this yields the trace-based\nDPO loss, which compares the joint probabilities of trace\u2013answer pairs (r+, y+) and (r\u2212, y\u2212):\n\nLt(\u03b8) = E(x,y\u00b1,r\u00b1)\u223cDt\n\n(cid:2)\u2113t(\u03b8; x, y\u00b1, r\u00b1)(cid:3) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u2113t represents the loss associated with a single pair of samples:\n\n\u2113t(\u03b8; x, y\u00b1, r\u00b1) = \u2212 log \u03c3\n\n(cid:18)\n\n\u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(r+, y+ | x)\n\u03c0ref(r+, y+ | x)\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(r\u2212, y\u2212 | x)\n\u03c0ref(r\u2212, y\u2212 | x)\n\n(cid:19)\n\n.\n\nThe trace-based gradient, gt = \u2207\u03b8\u2113t(\u03b8; x, r\u00b1, y\u00b1), provides a direct optimization signal by operat-\ning on full trajectories. While conceptually straightforward, its practical application is challenged\nby the significant variance of the gradient estimator, which can hinder stable training. This variance\nis a direct consequence of sampling the reasoning traces r. These traces are often long, vary widely\nin length, and are drawn from a vast search space, causing the joint log-probabilities log \u03c0\u03b8(r, y | x)\nto fluctuate dramatically across samples and yield a noisy gradient. We further provide empirical\nevidence in Appendix B that the variance of the log-probabilities and response length with trace\ngeneration is much higher than disabling trace generation. This provides concrete evidence that the\ninstability of the trace-based gradient is a significant bottleneck in practice.\n\n3.3 BIAS\u2013VARIANCE OPTIMIZED PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION\n\nThe standard trace-based loss Lt poses a significant challenge to stable alignment because of the high\nvariance of the gradient estimator. To address this issue, we propose Bias\u2013Variance Optimized\nPreference Optimization (BVPO), an algorithm that creates a more stable training objective by\ndirectly managing the bias\u2013variance trade-off. BVPO achieves this by combining the signal from\nthe high-variance Lt with a novel, low-variance component.\n\nEmpty-Trace Loss Le. To directly combat the source of the variance, we introduce the empty-\ntrace loss, Le. This objective bypasses the stochasticity of trace sampling by conditioning the policy\non a fixed, empty trace r = \u2205 and applying the DPO objective directly to the final answers. The full\nloss is the expectation of single-sample losses, \u2113e, over the dataset De:\n(cid:2)\u2113e(\u03b8; x, y\u2032\u00b1)(cid:3) ,\n\nLe(\u03b8) = E(x,y\u2032\u00b1)\u223cDe\n\nwhere \u2113e is defined for a single preference pair as:\n\n\u2113e(\u03b8; x, y\u2032\u00b1) = \u2212 log \u03c3\n\n(cid:18)\n\n\u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(r = \u2205, y\u2032+|x)\n\u03c0ref(r = \u2205, y\u2032+|x)\n\n\u2212 \u03b2 log\n\n\u03c0\u03b8(r = \u2205, y\u2032\u2212|x)\n\u03c0ref(r = \u2205, y\u2032\u2212|x)\n\n(cid:19)\n\n.\n\nThe gradient of this single-sample loss, ge = \u2207\u03b8\u2113e, exhibits lower variance because it avoids sam-\npling from the vast space of reasoning traces. The trade-off is a potentially higher bias, as it ignores\nthe reasoning process.\n\n4\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nCombined BVPO Loss Lc. To exploit the accuracy of the trace-based estimator while mitigating\nits variance with the stability of the empty-trace estimator, we define the combined BVPO loss as\ntheir convex combination:\n\nLc(\u03b8) = \u03b1Lt(\u03b8) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)Le(\u03b8),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] is a hyperparameter controlling the interpolation. The resulting gradient estimator\ngc is a weighted average of the individual estimators:\n\ngc = \u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge.\n\nThis formulation provides principled control over the bias\u2013variance trade-off. By tuning \u03b1, one can\nobtain a combined estimator gc that improves upon both gt and ge. In Section 4, we formally prove\nits variance-reduction property and show that gc achieves a more favorable bias\u2013variance balance\nthan either component alone.\n\ni )}N\n\ni , y\u00b1\n\nPractical Implementation of BVPO. Given a prompt dataset D = {xi}N\ni=1, we construct\nthe preference dataset for the Trace-Based Loss by sampling from \u03c0ref, yielding Dt =\n{(xi, r\u00b1\ni=1. For the Empty-Trace Loss, we disable reasoning trace generation by ap-\npending \u201c<think></think>\u201d to each input prompt xi, producing the preference dataset De =\n{(xi, yi\ni=1. Preference comparisons are made solely on the final responses y, since reason-\ning traces are often long, noisy, and include trial-and-error steps. This mirrors prior practice in\nDeepSeek-AI et al. (2025), where PPO was applied with rewards based only on y. Our mixed-\ngradient estimator gc is agnostic to the preference optimization algorithm. In practice, we instantiate\nit with the widely used DPO objective, yielding the combined BVPO loss in Equation (2).\n\n\u2032\u00b1)}N\n\n4 THEORETICAL ANALYSIS\n\nWe now ask: does the mixed estimator gc provably improve over its components gt and ge? We\nshow that it achieves variance reduction w.r.t. trace sampling (Theorem 1), optimal MSE guarantees\n(Theorem 2), and these statistical gains yield stronger convergence for SGD (Theorems 3 and 4).\n\n4.1 REDUCTION OF CONDITIONAL VARIANCE INDUCED BY TRACE SAMPLING\n\nThe high variance of the trace-based estimator gt often impedes stable optimization. To mitigate\nthis, our combined estimator gc incorporates the low-variance empty-trace estimator ge, reducing\nvariance while retaining the directional information of gt, as shown below.\nTheorem 1 (Conditional Variance Reduction for Trace Sampling). The trace-based estimator gt is\na random variable dependent on a sampled trace r\u00b1, while the empty-trace estimator ge is deter-\nministic with respect to trace sampling. For a vector-valued gradient g, its scalar variance is defined\nas the trace of its covariance matrix, Var(g) := tr(Cov(g)) = E[\u2225g \u2212 E[g]\u22252\n2].\n\nThe combined estimator gc = \u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge, with a fixed mixing coefficient \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], has a con-\nditional variance (with respect to trace sampling) that is bounded above by that of gt. Specifically,\nfor any data sample (x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1):\n\nVarr\u00b1 (gc | x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1) = \u03b12Varr\u00b1(gt | x, y\u00b1) \u2264 Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1).\n\nConsequently, the expected conditional variance is also bounded:\n\nEx,y\u00b1,y\u2032\u00b1[Varr\u00b1 (gc | x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1)] \u2264 Ex,y\u00b1 [Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1)].\n\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A.1. In this theorem, the first inequality is strict\nwhenever \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1) > 0.\nTheorem 1 formalizes a key benefit of our approach: incorporating the gradient estimator ge guaran-\ntees to reduce the variance stemming from trace sampling. The degree of this reduction is controlled\nby \u03b1. However, this benefit comes with a trade-off. While a smaller \u03b1 suppresses variance, it may\nincrease the bias with respect to the true marginal gradient by shifting the estimator\u2019s mean. This\nintroduces the classic bias-variance trade-off, which we analyze in the next section.\n\n5\n\n\fPreprint.\n\n4.2 OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF GRADIENT ESTIMATORS BY MSE MINIMIZATION\n\nTo determine the best balance between bias and variance, we seek the value of \u03b1 that minimizes the\nmean squared error (MSE) of gc with respect to the true marginal gradient, \u00b5 = \u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8). The\nMSE provides a comprehensive measure of estimator quality, as it simultaneously penalizes both\nvariance and systematic deviation from the target gradient.\nTheorem 2 (Optimal Convex Combination of Gradient Estimators). For two estimators gt and ge\nof the true marginal gradient \u00b5 := \u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8), assume the estimators have finite first and second\nmoments, with bias vectors bt := E[gt]\u2212\u00b5, be := E[ge]\u2212\u00b5, and covariance matrices \u03a3t = Cov(gt),\n\u03a3e = Cov(ge), and\n\n\u03a3te = Cov(gt, ge) = E[(gt \u2212 E[gt])(ge \u2212 E[ge])\u22a4].\n\nThe combined estimator gc(\u03b1) = \u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge for \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] has an MSE defined by\n\nMSE(gc(\u03b1)) := E[\u2225gc(\u03b1) \u2212 \u00b5\u22252].\n\nIf E[\u2225gt \u2212 ge\u22252] > 0, then the unconstrained value of \u03b1 that minimizes this MSE is:\n\n\u03b1unc =\n\ntr(\u03a3e \u2212 \u03a3te) + \u2225be\u22252 \u2212 b\u22a4\nE[\u2225gt \u2212 ge\u22252]\n\nt be\n\n,\n\nand the optimal parameter within the valid interval is \u03b1\u22c6 = max(0, min(1, \u03b1unc)). If E[\u2225gt \u2212\nge\u22252] = 0, then any \u03b1\u22c6 \u2208 [0, 1] is optimal.\n\nThis optimal estimator is guaranteed to be no worse than the better of the two individual estimators:\nMSE(gc(\u03b1\u22c6)) \u2264 min(cid:8)MSE(gt), MSE(ge)(cid:9).\n\nThe proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.2. Theorem 2 provides a principled method for\nfinding the optimal estimator gc(\u03b1\u22c6) among all possible convex combinations. The guarantee is\npowerful: our combined estimator can never underperform the best-performing individual estimator\nin terms of MSE. In fact, the improvement is typically strict, as formalized below.\nCorollary 1 (Strict Improvement Over gt). Assume E[\u2225gt \u2212 ge\u22252] > 0. If the optimal coefficient \u03b1\u22c6\nlies in the open interval (0, 1), then the combined estimator strictly dominates gt:\n\nMSE(gc(\u03b1\u22c6)) < MSE(gt).\nConsequently, unless the optimum lies at \u03b1\u22c6 = 1 or gt \u2261 ge, gc(\u03b1\u22c6) yields a strict improvement\nupon gt in MSE.\n\nBy symmetry, an analogous result holds when comparing against ge. If E[\u2225gt \u2212 ge\u22252] > 0 and\nthe optimal coefficient \u03b1\u22c6 lies in (0, 1), then MSE(gc(\u03b1\u22c6)) < MSE(ge). Thus, unless \u03b1\u22c6 = 0 or\ngt \u2261 ge, the combined estimator gc(\u03b1\u22c6) yields a strict improvement upon ge as well.\n\nThis statistical optimality of Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 has direct algorithmic implications. Specif-\nically, the property that the combined estimator gc(\u03b1\u22c6) minimizes the mean squared error with\nrespect to the true marginal gradient implies that it provides the most accurate gradient estimate on\naverage, balancing variance and bias. In stochastic optimization, the quality of the gradient estimate\nat each iteration governs both the stability and speed of convergence. An estimator with lower MSE\nyields update directions that are more faithful to the true gradient, simultaneously reducing stochas-\ntic noise and systematic drift. With the MSE-optimal estimator gc(\u03b1\u22c6), we therefore expect more\nstable optimization. The following section formalizes this intuition by analyzing the convergence\nbounds for SGD using our combined estimator.\n\n4.3 CONVERGENCE GUARANTEES FOR SGD\n\nHaving established that our estimator is statistically optimal in terms of MSE, we now connect this\nproperty to its algorithmic performance. In stochastic gradient descent (SGD), convergence is funda-\nmentally limited by the quality of the gradient estimates. To formalize this, we present the following\nconvergence Theorem 3. The theorem and its proof are adapted from Karimireddy et al. (2022),\nwhich builds upon the well-established analysis for SGD with biased gradients (e.g., Ghadimi &\n\n6\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nLan, 2013; Ajalloeian & Stich, 2020). This theorem is pivotal: it reveals that the convergence bound\nis governed by the estimator\u2019s squared bias and variance. Since MSE is precisely the sum of these\ntwo error terms (see Equation (5)), our approach of minimizing the MSE is explicitly designed to\nminimize the dominant factors that limit the algorithm\u2019s performance.\nTheorem 3 (SGD Convergence under BVPO Estimator). Let Lm : Rd \u2192 R be an L-smooth\nfunction with minimum value of L\u2217. Consider stochastic gradient descent: \u03b8k+1 = \u03b8k \u2212 \u03b7 gc(\u03b8k),\nwhere gc(\u03b8k) is the stochastic combined gradient estimator at iterate \u03b8k. Let \u00b5k := \u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8k)\ndenote the true marginal gradient. Define the conditional expectation and variance\n(cid:2)\u2225gc(\u03b8k) \u2212 Ek[gc(\u03b8k)]\u22252(cid:3),\n\nEk[\u00b7] := E[\u00b7 | \u03b8k],\n\nVark(gc) := Ek\n\nand the conditional bias vector Biask := Ek[gc(\u03b8k)]\u2212\u00b5k. If the constant step size satisfies \u03b7 \u2264 1/L,\nthen the averaged squared norm of the true gradient satisfies the exact bound:\n\n(cid:34)\n\nE\n\n1\nK\n\nK\u22121\n(cid:88)\n\nk=0\n\n(cid:35)\n\n\u2225\u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8k)\u22252\n\n\u2264\n\n2\nK\u03b7\n\n(cid:0)Lm(\u03b80) \u2212 E[Lm(\u03b8K)](cid:1) +\n\n1\nK\n\nK\u22121\n(cid:88)\n\nk=0\n\nE(cid:2)\u2225Biask\u22252 + \u03b7LVark(gc)(cid:3).\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nFurthermore, if there exist uniform bounds\n\u2225Biask\u2225 \u2264 Bc,\n\nVark(gc) \u2264 \u03c32\nc ,\n\n\u2200k,\n\nthen, using E[Lm(\u03b8K)] \u2265 L\u2217, the bound simplifies to\nK\u22121\n(cid:88)\n\n(cid:34)\n\n(cid:35)\n\n\u2225\u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8k)\u22252\n\n\u2264\n\nE\n\n1\nK\n\nk=0\n\n2(Lm(\u03b80) \u2212 L\u2217)\nK\u03b7\n\n+ B2\n\nc + \u03b7L \u03c32\nc .\n\nThe proof of this theorem is given in Section A.3. Theorem 3 gives a standard convergence guarantee\nfor SGD. In particular, the last two terms of Equation (4) define an error floor determined by the\nsquared bias and variance of the gradient estimator gc. This means that, although SGD converges\ntoward the optimum at the usual O(1/K) rate, its final accuracy is limited by the bias\u2013variance\ntradeoff of gc.\n\nTo reduce this error floor, we consider an adaptive estimator gc(\u03b1k, \u03b8k) = \u03b1kgt(\u03b8k) + (1 \u2212\n\u03b1k)ge(\u03b8k), where the mixing weight \u03b1k can be tuned at each iteration. Substituting this estima-\ntor into the general bound from Equation (3) gives\n\n(cid:34)\n\nE\n\n1\nK\n\nK\u22121\n(cid:88)\n\nk=0\n\n(cid:35)\n\n\u2225\u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8k)\u22252\n\n\u2264\n\n2\nK\u03b7\n\n(cid:0)Lm(\u03b80) \u2212 E[Lm(\u03b8K)](cid:1)\n\n+\n\n1\nK\n\nK\u22121\n(cid:88)\n\nk=0\n\nE(cid:2)\u2225Biask(\u03b1k)\u22252 + \u03b7L Vark(gc(\u03b1k))(cid:3).\n\nThe key observation is that the per-step error contribution\n\n\u2225Biask(\u03b1k)\u22252 + \u03b7L Vark(gc(\u03b1k))\n\ncan itself be minimized. In particular, when \u03b7L = 1, the standard bias\u2013variance decomposition,\n\nMSEk(gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)) = Ek\nshows that the optimal choice \u03b1\u22c6\nDetails of deriving Equation (5) are given in Appendix A.4.\n\n(cid:2)\u2225gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 \u00b5k\u22252(cid:3) = \u2225Biask(gc(\u03b1))\u22252 + Vark(gc(\u03b1)),\n(5)\nk is exactly the one that minimizes the MSE, as shown in Section 4.2.\n\nc + \u03c32\n\nc + \u03b7L \u03c32\n\nc , is essentially the MSE, B2\n\nThis establishes a direct link between statistical and algorithmic performance: the error floor in the\nSGD bound, B2\nc , up to the factor \u03b7L, which reflects the\nalgorithm\u2019s sensitivity to gradient noise. When \u03b7L \u2248 1, minimizing MSE is therefore equivalent to\nminimizing the convergence error. The following theorem formalizes this intuition.\nTheorem 4 (Optimality of the MSE-Minimal Estimator for SGD). Let the conditions of The-\norem 3 hold. At each iteration k, the per-step error in the convergence bound is Ek(\u03b1) :=\n\u2225Biask(gc(\u03b1))\u22252 + \u03b7L Vark(gc(\u03b1)). Let \u03b1\u22c6\nk be the weight that minimizes the conditional Mean\nSquared Error MSEk(gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)).\nIf the learning rate and smoothness constant satisfy \u03b7L = 1, then the MSE-optimal weight \u03b1\u22c6\nminimizes the per-step convergence error: Ek(\u03b1\u22c6\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nk also\n\nk) \u2264 Ek(\u03b1)\n\n7\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nTable 1: Experiment results on alignment benchmarks: Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2025) and AlpacaEval\n2 (Li et al., 2023).

We conduct experiments on three LRMs: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-\nQwen-7B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B (DeepSeek-AI\net al., 2025). These models are trained with chain-of-thought reasoning data using SFT from Qwen\n2.5 (Qwen et al., 2025) and Qwen 3 (Yang et al., 2025) base models, and have not been trained\nby RLHF. We use prompts from the UltraFeedback dataset (Cui et al., 2024) and let each model\ngenerate 5 responses with a temperature of 0.8. These responses are then ranked using the ArmoRM\nmodel (Wang et al., 2024). The response score is calculated only using the final answer part of\nthe response, following DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025). The highest and lowest-ranked responses are\nselected as the preferred and dispreferred samples, respectively. We use our gc with the DPO objec-\ntive to implement our BVPO and compare its performance against the original base models and two\nstate-of-the-art preference optimization methods: DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023a) and SimPO (Meng\net al., 2024).\n\nEvaluation Benchmarks. We evaluate alignment performance on two widely used open-ended\ninstruction-following benchmarks: Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2025) and AlpacaEval 2 (Li et al., 2023),\nwhich measure response quality across diverse prompts. For Arena-Hard, we report the win rate\nagainst GPT-4-0314. For AlpacaEval 2, we report both the win rate and the length-controlled win\nrate against GPT-4 Turbo. We assess LRMs in two modes: the standard reasoning mode, denoted\n\n8\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nTable 2: Experiment results on math reasoning benchmarks: AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AMC (Li\net al., 2024), Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), and MATH-\n500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021).\n\nMethod\n\nR1-Qwen-7B\nSimPO\nDPO\n\nBVPO\n\nMethod\n\nR1-Qwen-1.5B\nSimPO\nDPO\n\nBVPO\n\nMethod\n\nAIME 24 AIME 25 AMC MATH-500 Minerva Olympiadbench Avg.\n\n56.3\n55.8\n55.0\n\n58.4\n\n40.3\n38.2\n40.7\n\n41.0\n\n79.7\n80.7\n80.8\n\n81.2\n\n89.2\n88.2\n89.8\n\n89.4\n\n40.1\n41.2\n40.8\n\n43.0\n\n57.5\n58.4\n59.0\n\n60.9\n\n60.5\n60.4\n61.0\n\n62.3\n\nAIME 24 AIME 25 AMC MATH-500 Minerva Olympiadbench Avg.\n\n28.6\n30.2\n31.7\n\n34.4\n\n21.7\n23.3\n23.4\n\n24.4\n\n62.2\n62.5\n64.9\n\n65.1\n\n81.8\n82.6\n84.0\n\n83.0\n\n29.0\n30.5\n33.8\n\n35.3\n\n44.9\n46.2\n48.7\n\n50.1\n\n44.7\n45.9\n47.8\n\n48.7\n\nAIME 24 AIME 25 AMC MATH-500 Minerva Olympiadbench Avg.\n\nR1-0528-Qwen3-8B\nSimPO\nDPO\n\nBVPO\n\n73.1\n73.9\n73.6\n\n76.3\n\n66.0\n66.1\n65.9\n\n68.0\n\n91.8\n91.0\n91.0\n\n91.7\n\n96.4\n96.4\n97.6\n\n96.8\n\n47.1\n47.5\n47.1\n\n46.7\n\n73.5\n76.0\n76.0\n\n76.9\n\n74.7\n75.2\n75.2\n\n76.1\n\nThinking; and suppressing reasoning trace generation by appending \u201c<think></think>\u201d to the\ninput prompt, denoted NoThinking, reflecting scenarios in which users prefer instant responses with-\nout reasoning. To examine whether reasoning capabilities are preserved after alignment, we fur-\nther evaluate on six widely used math-reasoning benchmarks: AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AMC (Li\net al., 2024), Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), and MATH-\n500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021).

Additional experimental details are provided in Section C.\n\n5.2 MAIN RESULTS\n\nBVPO Consistently Improves Alignment. Table 1 reports alignment results on AlpacaEval 2\n(Li et al., 2023) and Arena-Hard (Li et al., 2025). Across both benchmarks, BVPO consistently\nsurpasses the best baselines. In Thinking mode, BVPO improves AlpacaEval 2 win rate by up to 7.8\npoints and the length-controlled win rate by up to 5.1 points, and increases the Arena-Hard win rate\nby up to 5.1 points. In NoThinking mode, BVPO yields gains of up to 6.8 points on Arena-Hard\nand up to 5.9 win rate and 6.9 length-controlled win rate points on AlpacaEval 2. These results\ndemonstrate BVPO\u2019s effectiveness by leveraging the bias-variance optimal gradient estimator.\n\nPreference Optimization Preserves and Improves Reasoning Ability. Because human preference\nalignment is typically the final tuning stage before deployment, it is crucial that preference optimiza-\ntion not erode LRMs\u2019 reasoning ability acquired from earlier reinforcement learning with verifiable\nrewards. As shown in Table 2, evaluated on six widely adopted math reasoning benchmarks (AIME\n2024, AIME 2025, AMC (Li et al., 2024), Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), OlympiadBench (He\net al., 2024), and MATH-500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021)), both DPO and BVPO maintain and improve\nLRMs\u2019 reasoning performance. Notably, BVPO achieves nontrivial gains of up to 4.0 average points\nacross these benchmarks over the base model and, on average, exceeds DPO. These findings indi-\ncate that preference alignment using general conversational (non\u2013math-specialized) training data\ndoes not sacrifice, and can in fact strengthen reasoning ability for LRMs.\n\n6 CONCLUSION\n\nWe have studied preference optimization for LRMs, where the statistically correct marginal objec-\ntive is intractable and practical single-trace surrogates suffer from high-variance gradients. We pro-\npose BVPO, which combines the standard trace-based gradient gt with a low-variance empty-trace\ngradient ge via convex combination: gc = \u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge. Theoretically, we prove that gc reduces\nvariance induced from trace sampling, and that with the optimal \u03b1, its MSE never exceeds that of\n\n9\n\n\fPreprint.\n\ngt, yielding sharper SGD convergence under standard assumptions. Empirically, BVPO consistently\nimproves alignment over DPO on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, while also enhancing reasoning\nperformance on math reasoning benchmarks. These results highlight trace sampling variance as a\nkey bottleneck for LRM alignment and show that explicitly optimizing the bias\u2013variance trade-off\nyields both stability and quality improvements.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nArash Ahmadian, Chris Cremer, Matthias Gall\u00b4e, Marzieh Fadaee, Julia Kreutzer, Olivier Pietquin,\nAhmet \u00a8Ust\u00a8un, and Sara Hooker.

We consider the conditional variance for fixed data sample (x, y\u00b1) and (x, y\u2032\u00b1) . The es-\ntimator ge is deterministic with respect to the trace sampling distribution p(r\u00b1 | x, y\u2032\u00b1). As the\nvariance of a deterministic quantity is zero, Varr\u00b1(ge | x, y\u2032\u00b1) = 0.\nThe conditional variance of the combined estimator gc is derived as follows, using the property that\nfor a random vector X and constant vector b, Var(aX + b) = a2Var(X):\n(cid:12)\n(cid:12) x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1(cid:1)\n\nVarr\u00b1\n\n(cid:0)gc | x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1(cid:1) = Varr\u00b1\n= Varr\u00b1\n\n(cid:0)\u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge\n(cid:0)\u03b1gt | x, y\u00b1(cid:1) + Varr\u00b1\n\n(cid:0)(1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge | x, y\u2032\u00b1(cid:1)\n\n13\n\n\fPreprint.\n\n+ 2 tr(Covr\u00b1\n\n(cid:0)\u03b1gt, (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge\n\n(cid:12)\n(cid:12) x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1(cid:1))\n\n= \u03b12 Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1)\n\n(cid:124)\n\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b1)2 Varr\u00b1 (ge | x, y\u2032\u00b1)\n(cid:125)\n\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n= 0\n+ 2\u03b1(1 \u2212 \u03b1) tr(Covr\u00b1 (gt, ge | x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1))\n(cid:125)\n\n(cid:124)\n\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n= 0\n\n= \u03b12 Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1).\n\nIn the third equality of the above equation, the variance and covariance with respect to ge is 0 due\nto ge is independent of r\u00b1 or constant under r\u00b1. Since \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], it follows that \u03b12 \u2264 1. Because\nvariance is non-negative, we have:\n\nThis directly implies the first inequality of this theorem:\n\n\u03b12Varr\u00b1(gt | x, y\u00b1) \u2264 Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1).\n\nVarr\u00b1 (gc | x, y\u00b1, y\u2032\u00b1) \u2264 Varr\u00b1 (gt | x, y\u00b1).\nTaking the expectation of this inequality with respect to the data distribution p(x, y\u00b1) yields the\nsecond inequality of this theorem, which completes the proof.\n\nA.2 PROOF OF THEOREM 2\n\nProof. The proof strategy is to express the MSE as a convex quadratic function of \u03b1 and find its\nminimum. The bias and scalar variance of the combined estimator gc(\u03b1) are used to define the MSE.\nThe bias vector is:\n\nBias(cid:0)gc(\u03b1)(cid:1) := E(cid:2)gc(\u03b1)(cid:3) \u2212 \u00b5,\n\n(cid:3) \u2212 \u00b5\n\n= E(cid:2)\u03b1gt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)ge\n= \u03b1E[gt] + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)E[ge] \u2212 \u00b5\n= \u03b1(cid:0)E[gt] \u2212 \u00b5(cid:1) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)(cid:0)E[ge] \u2212 \u00b5(cid:1)\n= \u03b1 bt + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) be,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u00b5 := \u2207\u03b8Lm(\u03b8).

If A > 0, the unconstrained minimizer\nis found by setting the derivative d(MSE)/d\u03b1 = 2A\u03b1 \u2212 2B to zero, which yields:\n\n\u03b1unc =\n\nB\nA\n\n.\n\nThis matches the expression in the theorem. To ensure the solution lies in the valid interval, the\noptimal constrained parameter is \u03b1\u22c6 = max(0, min(1, \u03b1unc)). If A = 0, then E[\u2225gt \u2212 ge\u22252] = 0,\nimplying gt = ge almost surely, so B = 0, MSE(gc(\u03b1)) is a constant, and any \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] is optimal.\n\nBy the property of convex functions, the minimum value over a closed interval must be less than\nor equal to the value at the endpoints. Here, the endpoints correspond to the individual estimators:\nMSE(gc(0)) = MSE(ge) and MSE(gc(1)) = MSE(gt). Thus, it directly follows that:\n\nMSE(gc(\u03b1\u22c6)) \u2264 min(cid:8)MSE(gt), MSE(ge)(cid:9).\n\nThis completes the proof.\n\nA.3 PROOF OF THEOREM 3\n\nProof.

Then the conditional mean\nsquared error (MSE) of gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) can be decomposed into its squared conditional bias and condi-\ntional variance as:\n\nMSEk(gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)) = Ek\n\n(cid:2)\u2225gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 \u00b5k\u22252(cid:3) = (cid:13)\n\n(cid:13)Biask(gc(\u03b1))(cid:13)\n2\n(cid:13)\n\n+ Vark(gc(\u03b1)),\n\nwhere\n\nBiask(gc(\u03b1)) := Ek[gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)] \u2212 \u00b5k,\nVark(gc(\u03b1)) := Ek\n\n(cid:2)\u2225gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 Ek[gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)]\u22252(cid:3).\n\nProof. Introduce the decomposition\n\ngc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 \u00b5k = (cid:0)gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 Ek[gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)](cid:1) + (cid:0)Ek[gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)] \u2212 \u00b5k\n\n(cid:1) = Dk + Biask(gc(\u03b1)),\n\n16\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nTable 3: Variance ratios of log-probability and sequence-length comparing Thinking to NoThinking.\n\nModel\n\nVariance ratio (log p) Variance ratio (length)\n\nR1-Qwen-7B\nR1-Qwen-1.5B\nR1-0528-Qwen3-8B\n\n10.17\n3.68\n1.23\n\n2.91\n1.32\n1.11\n\nwhere Dk = gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 Ek[gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k)].

Moreover, Ek[\u2225Dk\u22252] = Vark(gc(\u03b1)) by\nthe definition of conditional variance. Combining these results gives\n\nEk\n\n(cid:2)\u2225gc(\u03b1, \u03b8k) \u2212 \u00b5k\u22252(cid:3) = \u2225Biask(gc(\u03b1))\u22252 + Vark(gc(\u03b1)),\n\nwhich completes the proof.\n\nA.5 PROOF OF THEOREM 4\n\nProof. Under the condition \u03b7L = 1, the per-step convergence error simplifies to:\n\nEk(\u03b1) = \u2225Biask(gc(\u03b1))\u22252 + Vark(gc(\u03b1)),\nwhich is precisely the conditional MSE in Equation (5). Since Ek(\u03b1) \u2261 MSEk(\u03b1), the minimizer\nof one is necessarily the minimizer of the other.\n\nB ANALYSIS OF LRM\u2019S LOG-PROBABILITY AND SEQUENCE-LENGTH\n\nSTOCHASTICITY\n\nIn this section, we empirically quantify the stochasticity introduced by sampling reasoning traces,\ncompared with trace sampling disabled. The results support the claim that stochastic trace sampling\nincreases gradient variance, motivating our BVPO.\n\nB.1 SETUP\n\nFor each question, we sample five responses under two settings: reasoning-trace sampling enabled\n(Thinking) and disabled (NoThinking). Across the five samples, we compute the mean and variance\nof the joint log-probability and the sequence length, as well as the negative log-likelihood (NLL).\nWe then average these per-question statistics over all questions.\n\nB.2 RESULTS\n\nTrace Sampling Increases Variance.\nIn Table 3, we report the variance ratios of log-probability\nand sequence-length comparing Thinking to NoThinking. We can see that reasoning trace genera-\ntion increases dispersion in both joint log-probabilities and output lengths. Relative to NoThinking,\nThinking\u2019s variance of joint log-probabilities rises by up to 10.17 times while the variance of length\nrises by up to 2.91 times.\n\nTrace Sampling Increases Sequence Length and NLL. Table 4 complements variance with\nlength ratio and token-level predictability. Thinking yields substantially longer outputs by up to\n3.17 times. Per-token NLL increases by up to 21.5%. Because NLL is normalized by length, this\nworsening cannot be attributed solely to longer sequences; tokens generated with reasoning trace\ngeneration enabled are intrinsically harder to predict. In the preference optimization context, noisier\ntokens and longer trajectories compound to amplify gradient variability, reinforcing the need for an\nestimator that explicitly manages the bias\u2013variance trade-off.\n\n17\n\n\fPreprint.\n\nTable 4: Mean length ratio and NLL comparing Thinking to NoThinking.\n\nModel\n\nMean length ratio NLLThink NLLNo \u2206NLL % increase\n\nR1-Qwen-7B\nR1-Qwen-1.5B\nR1-0528-Qwen3-8B\n\n3.17\n2.72\n1.86\n\n0.384\n0.572\n0.456\n\n0.316\n0.496\n0.381\n\n0.068\n0.076\n0.075\n\n21.5%\n15.4%\n19.8%\n\nTable 5: Within-Thinking decomposition into trace vs. answer segments.

Within Thinking, the reasoning trace accounts for the ma-\njority of tokens (55\u201364% by length), and its per-token NLL is 1.15\u20131.73 times higher than the final\nanswer segment. This shows that the trace segment is both larger and less predictable, so fluctua-\ntions in log p(r, y | x) are predominantly trace-driven. These observations align with BVPO\u2019s design\nchoice to incorporate an empty-trace component: by construction it is agnostic to trace sampling,\nthereby reducing the conditional variance term that dominates in Thinking mode and tightening the\nconvergence floor in Equation (4).\n\nThese statistics provide strong empirical evidence for the stochasticity caused by reasoning trace\nsampling, highlighting the instability of the standard trace-based gradient estimator gt and motivat-\ning the need for our BVPO.\n\nC EXPERIMENT DETAILS\n\nC.1 HYPERPARAMETER SETTINGS\n\nWe use a consistent batch size of 128 and train all methods for 1 epoch in all settings.

However, the vanilla\ndecoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation: once a to-\nken is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a result, early\nmistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate predictions and fi-\nnal output quality. To address this issue, we propose TOLERATOR (Token-Level\nCross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding strategy that leverages\ncross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike existing methods that follow a\nsingle progressive unmasking procedure, TOLERATOR introduces a two-stage pro-\ncess: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii) iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a\nsubset of tokens while treating the remaining as context. This design enables pre-\nviously accepted tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, lead-\ning to more reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate TOLERATOR on\nfive standard benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and\nmathematics. Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improve-\nments over the baselines under the same computational budget. These findings\nsuggest that decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of dif-\nfusion large language models. Code and data are publicly available.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Hurst et al., 2024; Comanici et al.,\n2025) have driven remarkable progress across diverse NLP domains (Zhao et al., 2023; Minaee\net al., 2024). The dominant architecture behind these advances is the autoregressive (AR) trans-\nformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). While highly effective, AR decoding is inherently sequential, creating\na fundamental bottleneck that limits generation parallelism (Fu et al., 2024; Xia et al., 2024).\n\nTo address this, diffusion language models (Austin et al., 2021a; Li et al., 2022) have emerged as\na powerful alternative, generating sequences through iterative denoising with bidirectional attention\nand parallel token predictions. This paradigm offers distinct advantages over AR models (Li et al.,\n2025b), including accelerated inference, stronger global coherence, and controllable quality\u2013speed\ntrade-offs. Recent progress (Labs et al., 2025; Nie et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025b) has further demon-\nstrated the practicality and competitiveness of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLMs).\nCommercial dLLMs such as Mercury Coder (Labs et al., 2025) and Gemini Diffusion (Google\nDeepMind, 2025) claim to match the performance of autoregressive LLMs (Hurst et al., 2024; Team\net al., 2024) while achieving up to 10\u00d7 faster inference on tasks like code generation (Chen et al.,\n2021; Austin et al., 2021b).\n\nDespite recent advances, current discrete dLLM decoding strategies (Israel et al., 2025; Yu et al.,\n2025; Wu et al., 2025) suffer from a critical limitation: once a token is accepted, it is typically fixed\nand cannot be modified in later steps (Wang et al., 2025; von R\u00a8utte et al., 2025). For instance, in\ntwo widely adopted open-source dLLMs, LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025) and Dream (Ye et al., 2025b),\n\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPreprint. Under review\n\nFigure 1: Overview of TOLERATOR. Compared to the vanilla decoding strategy, we first fill the\nmasked tokens with high parallelism and then iteratively refine the draft through token-level cross-\nvalidation. Here, cross-validation means tokens alternately act as the target and the context of predic-\ntion. This process allows previously accepted tokens to be revisited and corrected when necessary.\n\na token is considered accepted if, at a specific iteration, it is unmasked and no longer remasked, as\nillustrated in Figure 1. Once accepted, it will serve as fixed context for all future predictions. This\ncauses early mistakes to persist and propagate throughout the generation process (Wang et al., 2025;\nvon R\u00a8utte et al., 2025).\n\nThere have been some early explorations on this issue. ReMDM (Wang et al., 2025) introduces a\nsampler that applies a stochastic backward remasking process for predicted tokens. RCR (He et al.,\n2025) tracks each token\u2019s running max confidence and remasks persistently low-confidence tokens.\nGIDD (von R\u00a8utte et al., 2025) trains diffusion models with a mixing schedule that interpolates\nbetween data and noise distributions to enable the remasking of predicted tokens. While these works\ndemonstrate the significance of dLLM decoding strategies, their improvements have not achieved\nideal performance on general tasks, so the challenge remains an open problem.\n\nTo further bridge this gap, we propose TOLERATOR (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement),\na test-time dLLM decoding method that explicitly separates generation into two stages: fill-up and\nrefinement. In the first stage, we fill up the masked tokens following vanilla dLLM decoding strat-\negy. In the second stage, we iteratively refine this draft by remasking and decoding subsets of tokens\nwhile using the remaining as context, so that predictions are revised by cross-validating against one\nanother. Our approach differs from existing strategies which perform refinement within the ongo-\ning generation process. By explicitly decoupling fill-up and refinement into two separate phases,\nTOLERATOR enables a more thorough form of token-level error correction than prior methods.\n\nWe evaluate TOLERATOR on five standard benchmarks across language understanding (Trivi-\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017), GPQA (Rein et al., 2024)), code generation (MBPP (Austin et al., 2021b),\nHumanEval (Chen et al., 2021)), and mathematics (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)). We use vanilla\ndecoding, ReMDM (Wang et al., 2025), and RCR (He et al., 2025) as baselines. Experimental results\nshow that, under the same computational cost measured by the number of forward steps, TOLERA-\nTOR achieves noticeable and consistent improvements over the baselines (relatively improves 17.9%\nfor Dream (Ye et al., 2025b) and 15.3% on LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025)). Overall, our findings indicate\nthat decoding strategy is not merely an implementation detail, but a crucial factor that substantially\ninfluences the performance of dLLMs.\n\n2 RELATED WORK\n\n2.1 FROM AUTOREGRESSION TO DIFFUSION\n\nModern natural language generation (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Suzgun et al., 2023; Rein et al., 2024)\nhas been dominated by the autoregressive (AR) model architectures like GPT (Brown et al., 2020)\n\n2\n\n\fPreprint. Under review\n\nand LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023). Despite its empirical success, AR models introduce a fun-\ndamental bottleneck: generation is inherently sequential, limiting decoding parallelism (Li et al.,\n2023; Zou et al., 2023). To address this limitation, diffusion language models (Austin et al., 2021a;\nLi et al., 2022) have emerged as a promising alternative (Li et al., 2025b). By reversing a noising\nprocess over multiple steps, diffusion language models generate tokens in parallel (Labs et al., 2025)\nwhile leveraging full bidirectional attention (Nie et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025b).\n\nExisting diffusion language models can be classified into three main categories depending on how\nthe diffusion process is applied. Early continuous diffusion language models (Li et al., 2022; Strudel\net al., 2022; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2024; Lovelace et al., 2023; Dieleman et al., 2022) denoised\nembeddings before mapping them back to tokens. However, this paradigm struggles with issues like\noptimization and has largely been replaced by discrete diffusion language models. Discrete diffusion\nlanguage models (Austin et al., 2021a; He et al., 2023) define diffusion directly in token space, and\nfurther scale up model parameter size (Gong et al., 2025), achieving the state-of-the-art with open-\nsource models like Dream (Ye et al., 2025b) and LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025). A third line integrates\nAR philosophy with diffusion, including block-wise or multi-level scheduling (Han et al., 2023;\nWu et al., 2023) and the reintroduction of sequential dependency while retaining diffusion-style\nrefinement (Arriola et al., 2025; Huang & Tang, 2025).\n\n2.2 TRAINING AND INFERENCE STRATEGIES IN DIFFUSION LANGUAGE MODELS\n\nBeyond architectural explorations, another line of work studies how to effectively train diffusion\nLMs. Large-scale instruction tuning (Ye et al., 2025b; Nie et al., 2025) has demonstrated that dif-\nfusion models can achieve general capabilities comparable to autoregressive LLMs. Researchers\nalso explore refinements of the training objective: simplified masked losses (Shi et al., 2024; Sahoo\net al., 2024), likelihood-based formulations (Gulrajani & Hashimoto, 2023), and variants that en-\nhance generation robustness and reasoning (von R\u00a8utte et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025a). Another direc-\ntion focuses on adapting reinforcement learning to diffusion, either to strengthen reasoning (Huang\n& Tang, 2025; Ye et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2025) or for preference optimization (Zhu et al., 2025).\n\nDecoding is another key bottleneck for diffusion language models: parallel generation improves ef-\nficiency but often degrades quality. Adaptive Parallel Decoding (APD) (Israel et al., 2025) mitigates\nthis trade-off by adjusting the degree of parallelism with an auxiliary autoregressive verifier, while\ndilated (Luxembourg et al., 2025) scheduling further accelerates inference. At the same time, KV-\ncaching (Ma et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025) and autoregressive-guided unmasking (Hu et al., 2025) are\napplied to further accelerate dLLMs. Recent works (Li et al., 2025a; Kim et al., 2025) also address\nflexibility by extending diffusion to variable-length and token insertion.\n\n2.3 ERROR CORRECTION IN DIFFUSION DECODING\n\nIt is often claimed that vanilla discrete diffusion language models possess an inherent ability for error\ncorrection, since each position is repeatedly predicted as the context evolves over iterations (Wang\net al., 2025; Google DeepMind, 2025). However, this view is incomplete: once a token is accepted,\nit becomes fixed and cannot be revised. For example, LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025) and Dream (Ye et al.,\n2025b) decide at every iteration whether a token should be further remasked; if it is not, the token\nis considered accepted and remains unchanged thereafter. As a result, any early mistake will persist\nand propagate through subsequent steps, limiting the reliability of diffusion generation.\n\nSeveral methods have sought to address this limitation. ReMDM (Wang et al., 2025) introduces a\nprobabilistic remasking process that allows already revealed tokens to be re-predicted. RCR (He\net al., 2025) proposes a simple confidence-based strategy that remasks uncertain tokens during in-\nference. GIDD (von R\u00a8utte et al., 2025) modifies the corruption process with hybrid noise during\ntraining. While these approaches demonstrate the feasibility of token revision, their empirical gains\nremain relatively modest on general tasks or they require additional training, leaving the core prob-\nlem unresolved. In contrast, our approach departs from prior work by explicitly decoupling fill-up\nand refinement. We first generate a draft following vanilla diffusion decoding, and then apply a\ntargeted refinement stage that revisits the accepted tokens according to a cross-validation princi-\nple. This separation not only makes error correction conceptually more systematic but also delivers\nmarkedly stronger empirical gains.\n\n3\n\n\fPreprint. Under review\n\n3 METHODOLOGY\n\n3.1 PRELIMINARIES\n\nDecoding in Discrete dLLMs. We consider the decoding process of discrete diffusion large\nlanguage models (Ye et al., 2025b; Nie et al., 2025). Specifically, let x(t)\ni \u2208 V denote the token at\nposition i \u2208 {1, . . . , L} and time step t \u2208 {0, . . . , T }, where V is the vocabulary, L is the sequence\nlength, and T is the total number of forward steps. At inference time, the sequence is initialized with\n\nx(0) = (cid:0)c1, . . . , cm, [MASK]m+1, . . . , [MASK]L\n(cid:1) \u2208 V L,\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nL\u2212m\n\nwhere c1 to cm are prompt tokens and the remaining L \u2212 m positions are masked tokens. At each\ntime step, discrete diffusion large language models output the logits of all masked tokens and decode\nthem by sampling, where y(t)\ni \u223c p\u03b8(\u00b7 | x(t), t), and p\u03b8 is the conditional distribution parameterized\nby the dLLMs. A deterministic rule then decides whether to accept or remask each decoded token.\nSpecifically, the next sequence is constructed as\n\nx(t+1)\ni\n\n=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\ny(t)\ni\n\n,\n\naccepted,\n\n\uf8f3\n\n[MASK],\n\nremasked,\n\nfor i /\u2208 It,\n\nx(t+1)\nj\n\n= x(t)\nj\n\nfor j \u2208 It.\n\nwhere It \u2286 {1, . . . , L} is the index set of tokens already accepted at step t. In the vanilla setup,\neach step accepts approximately \u230aL/T \u230b tokens, which are selected based on criteria like model\nconfidence or entropy. Different dLLMs may adopt alternative decoding strategies. For example,\nsemi-autoregressive decoding (Nie et al., 2025) only proceeds to the next block once all tokens in\nthe current block have been accepted. Our study focuses on the vanilla setup, as it is widely adopted\nin existing dLLMs.\n\nLimitations of Conventional Discrete dLLM Decoding.\nIn the conventional decoding setup,\nmasked positions are iteratively unmasked and decoded, while accepted tokens become fixed and\nremain unchanged. Formally, once a position index i enters the visible set It, we have i \u2208 It\u2032 and\nx(t\u2032)\ni = x(t)\nfor all t\u2032 > t. As a result, an early error at position j \u2208 It is permanently preserved and\nenters the context for all future predictions p\u03b8(x(t\u2032)\n| x(t\u2032\u22121), t\u2032 \u2212 1), where i /\u2208 It\u2032\u22121. Such errors\ni\ncannot be revised and may propagate through the decoding process as persistent noise, ultimately\ndegrading the quality of the generated sequence.\n\ni\n\n3.2 METHOD OVERVIEW\n\nTo overcome this limitation, we propose TOLERATOR (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement),\nwhich moves beyond the traditional view of decoding as a single, progressive unmasking trajectory,\nand instead reframes it as a two-stage process of fill-up and refinement.\n\nStage I (Sequence Fill-Up).\nIn the fill-up stage, the model produces a coarse draft by filling\nmasked positions following the vanilla dLLM decoding strategy, providing a complete but poten-\ntially imperfect hypothesis of the output.\n\nStage II (Cross-Validation Refinement). In the refinement stage, our iterative procedure follows\na token-level cross-validation principle, where tokens alternately act as validator and as validation\ntargets. This alternating role improves the overall consistency of generated sequence.\n\nOverall, this design offers a training-free, model-agnostic solution to the challenge of irreversible\nearly errors and their propagation in the decoding process.\n\n3.3 SEQUENCE FILL-UP\n\nThe sequence fill-up stage is largely based on the vanilla dLLM decoding procedure described in\nSection 3.1. However, to facilitate the refinement stage, we introduce one modification: the logit\npenalty on the End-of-Text (EoT) token.\n\n4\n\n\fPreprint. Under review\n\nEoT Penalty. Since the refinement stage can correct errors, we prefer longer and more informative\ndrafts to overly short completions. To this end, we apply an EoT penalty (Bai et al., 2021; Laban\net al., 2020), which discourages the generation of EoT tokens in the fill-up stage. Concretely, we\nscale down the logit of the EoT token by a factor \u03bbeot > 1 before softmax. While this adjustment\ndoes not directly improve draft quality, it effectively prevents early termination and produces drafts\nthat are better suited for subsequent refinement. Formally, let zv be the unnormalized logit for token\nv at position i and time step t. The penalized distribution is\n\n\u02dcp\u03b8(v | x(t), t) \u221d\n\n(cid:26)exp(zv)/\u03bbeot,\nexp(zv),\n\nif v = [EoT]\notherwise.\n\nFinally, the fill-up stage produces a sequence consisting of the prompt tokens and model predictions\nfor previously masked positions:\n\nx(\u03c1T ) = (cid:0)c1, . . . , cm, x(\u03c1T )\n\nm+1, . . . , x(\u03c1T )\n\nL\n\n(cid:1) \u2208 V L,\n\nwhere x(\u03c1T )\n\ni\n\n\u0338= [MASK] for all i > m. Here \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1) controls the split between the two stages.\n\n3.4 CROSS-VALIDATION REFINEMENT\n\nThe refinement stage corrects errors in the draft with a token-level cross-validation principle, where\ntokens alternately act as validator and as validation targets.\nIn each iteration, a different subset\nof tokens is sampled, remasked and decoded conditioned on the preserved context, progressively\nreducing mistakes and improving coherence.\n\nIterative Refinement. At each iteration k, we remask a random subset S(k) \u2286 {m + 1, . . . , L} of\nnon-prompt positions, sampled at rate \u03b3k so that |S(k)| = \u230a\u03b3k(L \u2212 m)\u230b.\n\n(cid:40)\n\nx(k)\ni =\n\n[MASK],\nx(k)\n,\ni\n\ni \u2208 S(k)\notherwise.\n\nThe sequence for the next iteration is then obtained by predicting the masked tokens:\n\nx(k+1)\ni\n\n=\n\n(cid:40)\n\ny(k)\ni\nx(k)\ni\n\n,\n,\n\ni \u2208 S(k)\notherwise,\n\nwhere y(k)\n\ni \u223c p\u03b8(\u00b7 | x(k), k).\n\nIn each iteration, a subset of generated tokens is held fixed as context, while the remaining tokens are\nremasked and decoded to better align with the fixed context tokens. Iterating this process gradually\nimproves the coherence of the entire sequence.\n\nAnnealed Refinement Rate. To improve the stability of refinement steps, we anneal the refine-\nment rate \u03b3k over time. Higher refinement rates in early iterations encourage broader corrections of\ninitial errors, while lower rates in later iterations help stabilize the predictions. We adopt a cosine\nannealing schedule with both upper and lower bounds:\n\n\u03b3k = \u03b3min + 1\n\n2 (\u03b3max \u2212 \u03b3min) (cid:0)1 + cos(cid:0) \u03c0k\n\nK\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1) ,\n\nwhere k is the current refinement iteration and K is the total number of refinement steps.\n\n4 EXPERIMENT\n\n4.1 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\n\nModels. Following previous studies (Ma et al., 2025; Israel et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025; He et al.,\n2025), we evaluate our method on two representative open-source discrete dLLMs: Dream-v0-\nInstruct-7B (Ye et al., 2025b) and LLaDA-8B-Instruct (Nie et al., 2025). Both are state-of-the-art\nrepresentatives of open-source discrete diffusion large language models.\n\n5\n\n\fPreprint. Under review\n\nDatasets & Metrics. To assess the general effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three rep-\nresentative tasks with five standard benchmarks: (i) language understanding with TriviaQA (Joshi\net al., 2017) and GPQA (Rein et al., 2024), (ii) code generation with HumanEval (Chen et al.,\n2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021b), and (iii) mathematics with GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021).\nWe report accuracy for TriviaQA, GPQA, GSM8K and pass@1 for HumanEval and MBPP.\n\nBaselines. We compare our method against the vanilla decoding strategy and two training-free\nbaselines that propose to revise the accepted tokens. (i) Vanilla follows the standard dLLM decoding\nprocedure: once a token is accepted, it remains fixed throughout the generation process and cannot\nbe revised. (ii) ReMDM (Wang et al., 2025) introduces a stochastic sampler that applies a backward\nremasking process for predicted tokens. (iii) RCR (He et al., 2025) records each token\u2019s running\nmax confidence and remasks persistently low-confidence tokens.\n\nConfigurations. For fairness, all methods are evaluated with the same dLLM backbones in the\nzero-shot setting. We equalize the computational cost between baselines and our method by allocat-\ning the same total forward-step budget. Specifically, for our method, we set the allocation ratio \u03c1\nbetween sequence fill-up and refinement to 0.5. However, it is worth noting that our method itself\nhas no restriction on how steps are allocated. This constraint is introduced solely to ensure a fair\ncomparison.\n\nFor our method, we adopt a cosine annealing scheduler for the refinement rate with \u03b3max = 0.8 and\n\u03b3min = 0.4, and increase the EoT penalty \u03bbeot from 1.0 to 1.3 as the number of forward steps T\ngrows. For baselines, we use the recommended hyperparameters for ReMDM (ton = 0.55, toff =\n0.05, \u03b1on = 0.9) and use the linear remasking scheduling function for RCR, which is reported to be\noptimal (He et al., 2025).\n\nWe follow the default prompts from the LM-Eval framework (Gao et al., 2024) and fix the generation\nlength L at 256. The total number of forward steps T varies from 4 to 256 in powers of two,\ncovering the scenarios from highly parallel to fully sequential decoding. All experiments are run on\n8 NVIDIA H200 GPUs, and each data point is evaluated with three random seeds to ensure statistical\nsignificance.\n\n4.2 MAIN RESULTS\n\nFigure 2: Performance-Efficiency Trade-Off for Different Decoding Methods. This figure il-\nlustrates the performance of different methods under varying parallel sizes. Gray bars represent\ngeneration throughput (tokens per second, TPS). Colored lines show average performance across\nfive benchmarks as forward step T varies.\n\nTo systematically evaluate performance across tasks and inference speeds, we compared our method\nagainst three baselines on five standard datasets. Some prior work (Nie et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025b;\nZhu et al., 2025) mainly focused on non-parallel decoding, where the number of forward steps equals\nthe generation length. This setting achieves the highest accuracy but is also the most computationally\nexpensive. In contrast, we additionally examined parallel decoding scenarios, which we consider to\nbe an essential feature of dLLMs and more common in practical applications (Labs et al., 2025;\nGoogle DeepMind, 2025). Specifically, for a generation length of L = 256, we varied the forward\n\n6\n\n48163264128256Forward Steps1020304050Average Performance (%)Dream48163264128256Forward Steps102030LLaDA2.04.06.08.00.51.01.52.0TPS (\u00d710\u00b3)VanillaReMDMRCRTolerator\fPreprint.

On average,\nthe percentage score increases from 29.0 to 34.6 (+17.9% relatively). On LLaDA, improvements\nare similarly strong and remain stable even at extreme settings (steps = 4 and 256), with average\nperformance increased from 21.3 to 24.5 (+15.3% relatively). These results demonstrate that our\napproach improves over the baselines and adapts well across different levels of parallelism.\n\nFigure 3 summarizes performance across the five tasks, averaged over all forward steps. In most\ncases, our method outperforms the baselines. For instance, on Dream, the average score on TriviaQA\nimproves from 24.8 to 36.1 (+45.16% relatively), while on LLaDA, the score on GSM8K improves\nfrom 30.46 to 46.28 (+51.91% relatively). Overall, these findings highlight the robustness and broad\napplicability of our method as a general improvement of dLLM decoding strategies.\n\n4.3 ABLATION STUDIES\n\nTo analyze the effect of different components in our decoding strategy, we conduct ablation studies\non (i) token-level cross-validation refinement, (ii) EoT Penalty, and (iii) refinement rate annealing.\n\nTable 1: Performance under different refinement steps (#R) with fixed fill-up stage steps.

We fix the number of forward steps in the fill-up stage at 16 and\n64, then gradually increase the number of cross-validation refinement steps (#R) from 0 to 256. The\nresults are shown in Table 1. We first observe that even a small number of refinement steps leads\nto substantial performance gains. For instance, on GSM8K, LLaDA achieves 22.87 with vanilla\ndecoding in 16 steps. Adding just 4 refinement steps nearly doubles performance to 48.44.\n\nMoreover, on GSM8K, increasing the number of refinement steps to 128 or even 256 continues to\nyield steady improvements. On GPQA, the trend is less pronounced, but the benefit of enabling\ncross-validation refinement is consistent: across all step counts, refinement outperforms the baseline\n\n7\n\nTriviaQAGPQAHumanEvalMBPPGSM8K1020304050Average Performance (%)DreamTriviaQAGPQAHumanEvalMBPPGSM8K1020304050LLaDAVanillaReMDMRCRTolerator\fPreprint.

Overall,\nthese results demonstrate that the cross-validation refinement design is effective and well-motivated.\n\nFigure 4: Ablation Studies of EoT Penalty. We fix the fill-up and refinement configurations while\nvarying \u03bbeot from 1.0 to 1.3, with results shown for 32 and 128 forward step T . Across most tasks,\nintroducing an appropriate EoT penalty substantially improves generation quality. The precise nu-\nmerical values are reported in Appendix A.\n\nEoT penalty. To isolate the impact of the EoT penalty, we fix the fill-up and refinement config-\nurations and vary only the penalty coefficient \u03bbeot. Specifically, we vary \u03bbeot from 1.0 to 1.3 while\nkeeping the number of forward step T fixed at 32 and 128. We find that applying non-trivial \u03bbeot\nconsistently improves generation quality, with notable gains at \u03bbeot = 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 (+23.2%,\n+28.4%, +23.9% relatively). This is because the EoT penalty encourages longer fill-up sequence:\nalthough these drafts may not always be fully correct, they tend to contain more information overall.\nDuring refinement, the useful content can be preserved and amplified while the incorrect parts are\nlikely to be corrected.\n\nTable 2: Performance of LLaDA and Dream models with and without refinement rate anneal-\ning.

A rate that is too small makes it difficult to effectively revise vali-\ndated tokens, while a rate that is too large limits the available context and lowers refinement quality.\nThus, choosing an appropriate refinement rate is essential for stable performance. To achieve this\nbalance, we introduce cosine annealing of the refinement rate, which provides sufficient momentum\nin the early steps of refinement while ensuring stability in the later steps.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this design, we compare the performance of Dream and LLaDA\non GSM8K and TriviaQA with and without refinement rate annealing across different numbers of\nforward steps (Table 2). For LLaDA, annealing consistently delivers an average improvement of\n+2.1 points across all step settings on GSM8K. For Dream, while exceptions occur at 4 and 64\nsteps, the overall effect is still an average improvement of +1.3 points on this dataset. On TriviaQA,\nrefinement rate annealing remains effective across most forward steps, delivering average gains of\n\n8\n\nGPQAGSM8KGPQAGSM8K204060Performance (%)32 steps128 stepsDreamGPQAGSM8KGPQAGSM8K20406032 steps128 stepsLLaDAeot=1.0eot=1.1eot=1.2eot=1.3\fPreprint. Under review\n\n+2.8 on LLaDA and +1.3 on Dream. These results demonstrate that refinement rate annealing is,\noverall, a robust and effective strategy.\n\nFurthermore, Appendix C presents several case studies that qualitatively illustrate the error correc-\ntion process of our method.\n\n5 DISCUSSION\n\n5.1 WHY OUR METHOD CAN BE TRAINING-FREE?\n\nOur method does not require additional training, yet still achieves significant improvements, because\nthe refinement stage closely matches the training objective of dLLMs. During training, these models\nreconstruct randomly masked tokens given the visible context, and the loss is computed uniformly\nover all masked positions. This is exactly what our refinement stage does: in each iteration, a subset\nof tokens is remasked and predicted conditioned on the others, so that every token can in turn act as\ntarget or context under the same conditional distribution the model was optimized for.\n\nVanilla decoding, by contrast, is not fully consistent with this training setup. At inference it accepts\na small set of the most confident tokens (based on logit features). The predictions are evaluated only\non those high-confidence positions, while other masked tokens contribute nothing and simply get\nremasked\u2014despite the fact that, during training, losses were computed on them as well.\n\n5.2 WHY OUR STRATEGY IS GOOD FOR LARGE PARALLEL SIZES?\n\nOur method achieves better improvements in parallel decoding scenarios, i.e., when the forward step\nis smaller than the sequence length and multiple tokens are decoded in each forward step.\n\nOne key reason may lie in the visibility constraint during parallel decoding: tokens generated within\nthe same step cannot attend to each other, which often leads to local inconsistencies. This phe-\nnomenon is even more noticeable with larger parallel sizes. Our token-level cross-validation pro-\ncess helps to mitigate this issue. During cross-validation, tokens filled up in the same step can be\nvalidated such that one serves as context (or validator) while another serves as the validation target.\nThis mechanism enables tokens that were originally invisible to each other to interact directly\u2014for\nexample, when validating token A, token B (from the same step) can now be used as part of the con-\ntext. Such interactions promote coherence among simultaneously decoded tokens. By repeating this\nprocess across multiple rounds, inconsistencies introduced by parallel decoding are progressively\nreduced, resulting in more coherent sequences overall.\n\nIn contrast, when the forward step equals the sequence length (i.e., non-parallel decoding with one\ntoken per step), every token naturally conditions on all previously accepted tokens. Since there is\nno within-step invisibility, the inconsistency problem does not arise, and thus the potential benefit\nof our method is relatively limited in this scenario.\n\n5.3 LIMITATIONS\n\nFormat Stability. Although our method achieves consistent improvements across benchmarks,\nthe gains are relatively smaller on code generation tasks such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and\nMBPP (Austin et al., 2021b). These tasks are highly format-sensitive, where even slight deviations\nin syntax or structure can render an otherwise correct solution invalid. Because our refinement\nprocess operates purely at the token level and does not enforce explicit structural constraints, it can\noccasionally disrupt the formatting of well-formed code. This indicates a limitation of our approach\nwhen applied to domains that demand strict output adherence. A similar limitation has also been\nnoted in methods such as RCR (He et al., 2025), which require heavier remasking than vanilla\ngeneration and can likewise compromise sequence formatting.\n\nNatural Convergence. The cross-validation refinement in our method can be viewed as an iter-\native self-mapping process, where the input and output spaces are identical. Ideally, such a pro-\ncess should terminate naturally when, after a certain iteration, the sequence reaches a stable fixed\npoint\u2014subsequent updates would then map the sequence onto itself, eliminating the need to prede-\nfine a fixed number of steps. In practice, however, our current approach does not exhibit this kind\n\n9\n\n\fPreprint. Under review\n\nof natural convergence. Even after many refinement steps, while the number of tokens edited by the\nmodel tends to decrease, it never converges to zero. Instead, the process continues to oscillate.\n\n6 CONCLUSION\n\nIn this work, we revisited a key limitation of diffusion large language models (dLLMs): once a token\nis accepted during decoding, it is typically fixed and cannot be revised, causing early mistakes to\npersist and propagate through subsequent iterations. To address this, we proposed TOLERATOR, a\ntraining-free decoding strategy that explicitly decouples decoding into fill-up and refinement stages.\nBy first generating a coarse draft and then iteratively remasking and decoding tokens with the token-\nlevel cross-validation principle, TOLERATOR enables more systematic and effective error correction\nthan prior approaches.\n\nThrough extensive experiments on five benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, code\ngeneration, and mathematical reasoning, we showed that TOLERATOR consistently improves over\nbaselines under the same forward step budgets. Beyond empirical gains, our results highlight that\ndecoding strategy is not merely an implementation choice, but a crucial component that influences\nthe overall performance of dLLMs.\n\nETHICS STATEMENT\n\nAll datasets used in this work (TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), GPQA (Rein et al., 2024),\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021b)) are\npublicly available academic benchmarks that do not contain personally identifiable or sensitive in-\nformation. Our study focuses on improving inference in discrete diffusion language models and does\nnot involve the collection of new human subject data. We acknowledge that large language mod-\nels may generate incorrect or misleading content, and that code generation models can potentially\nproduce insecure or faulty programs. Our method does not eliminate these risks, and users should\nexercise caution when deploying such systems in high-stakes scenarios. The potential societal ben-\nefits of our work include improved decoding performance of diffusion large language models. This\nresearch was conducted in accordance with the ICLR Code of Ethics. The authors take full respon-\nsibility for all analyses and conclusions presented in this paper.\n\nREPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\n\nWe have taken several steps to ensure the reproducibility of our results. Our experiments were con-\nducted on two representative open-source discrete diffusion language models: Dream-v0-Instruct-\n7B (Ye et al., 2025b) and LLaDA-8B-Instruct (Nie et al., 2025). We evaluate across five widely\nused public benchmarks\u2014TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), GPQA (Rein et al., 2024), GSM8K (Cobbe\net al., 2021), HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021b). For all methods, we\nadopt the same model backbones, zero-shot setting, and equalized computational budgets to guar-\nantee fairness. Reported results are averaged over 3 random seeds, and exact numerical results for\nboth main experiments and ablations are provided in the appendix. We detail hyperparameter con-\nfigurations in Section 4.1, including scheduler settings, penalty coefficients, and baseline parameters\n(ReMDM (Wang et al., 2025) and RCR (He et al., 2025)). Code, configuration files, and data pre-\nprocessing scripts are made anonymously available to facilitate replication. With the provided code\nand instructions, our results can be reproduced using 8\u00d7H200 GPUs or equivalent hardware.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAnthropic.

GPT-\n5 (OpenAI, 2025) was employed solely to assist with language polishing and improving the read-\nability of the manuscript. In addition, Claude Code (Anthropic, 2025) was used as a coding assistant\nto generate and debug experimental scripts. At no point did LLMs contribute to the core research\nideas, methodology, or interpretation of results. All scientific contributions, analyses, and conclu-\nsions remain the responsibility of the authors. Outputs produced by LLMs were carefully reviewed\nand revised where necessary to ensure accuracy and integrity.\n\nC QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES\n\nIn this section, we present a qualitative case study showing how cross-validation refinement performs\ntoken-level error correction. Consider the GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) query: \u201cMarilyn\u2019s first\nrecord sold 10 times as many copies as Harald\u2019s. If they sold 88,000 copies combined, how many\ncopies did Harald sell?\u201d\n\nFigure 5 shows LLaDA (Nie et al., 2025) with 16 fill-up forward steps without refinement. Different\ncolors indicate the decoding order. Early steps are syntactically and semantically reasonable, but\nby step 16 (orange) the output degrades\u2014failing to carry out precise arithmetic (e.g., producing\n\u201c88,000000\u201d) and losing grammatical consistency (e.g., \u201cthe number the number\u201d).\n\nCross-validation refinement then iteratively edits inconsistent tokens and inserts more appropriate\nones. Figures 6, 7 and 8 show results after 1, 8, and 16 refinement steps, respectively. After one step,\nredundant tokens like \u201cthe number the number\u201d are removed and spurious digits are trimmed (e.g.,\n\u201c88,000000\u201d \u2192 \u201c88,000\u201d), though minor issues (e.g., fragments like \u201cHar Harald\u201d) may remain.\nAs refinement proceeds, the text becomes well-formed and the arithmetic is corrected, ultimately\nconverging to the correct answer: 88,000.\n\nThis example indicates that dLLMs already contain the knowledge needed to solve the problem\nsince initial generations include relevant fragments such as \u201c88\u201d and \u201c00/0000\u201d, but benefit from a\nmore stable mechanism for parallel language modeling. Cross-validation refinement provides this\nmechanism, enabling correction over iterations.\n\n16\n\n\fPreprint.

    "abstract": "Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern\nimage editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the\nediting process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement,\nwhere changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and\ncontinuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We\nintroduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level\nmanipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the\nembeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the\ntarget attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder\n(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our\nmethod operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion\nprocess, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image\nsynthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient\nmanipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.",

A key element\nof our approach are Random Utility (RU) McFadden [1973] & McFadden [1981]\nand Discrete Choice Models (DCMs) Ben-Akiva and Lerman [1985] & Train [2009],\nwhich are crucial for capturing individual preferences and choices. These models al-\nlow us to analyze the decision-making processes underlying travel behavior, offering\na detailed understanding of how factors such as cost, time, and convenience influence\nmode and route selection. By integrating these established models with advanced\ndata techniques, our approach significantly improves predictive accuracy and policy\nrelevance, demonstrating clear value over the conventional FSTM framework.\n\nRecognizing that the quality of our findings depends on the data used, we care-\nfully selected the datasets for this research. Our study draws on regional household\ntravel surveys, such as the Puget Sound Regional Commission (PSRC) Household\nTravel Survey, as well as publicly available microdata like the U.S. Census Public\nUse Microdata Sample (PUMS), which underlies the American Community Survey\n(ACS) tables. Together, these datasets provide a solid foundation for our analysis\nby offering comprehensive insights into demographic, socioeconomic, and travel be-\nhavior characteristics. Leveraging this rich data, we employ a combination of raking\nand machine learning methods to develop a replicable and reproducible approach\nfor generating high-resolution insights on individuals\u2019 travel behavior \u2013 demand,\ndistribution, routes and mode - at fine geographic scale. By integrating traditional\nstatistical techniques with advanced computational methods, our approach guaran-\ntees that demand estimates are both accurate and reliable.\n\nA key innovation in our approach is the development of a framework that lever-\nages synthetic population generated through an iterative proportional fitting (IPF)\nmethod, ensuring that our estimates reflect the diverse and dynamic nature of pop-\nulations of interest. By offering a richer assessment of the local travel pattern for\nspecific population cohorts, the study highlights the primary drivers of change, the\ndirections and magnitudes of these changes, the factors that may be amenable to\npolicy modification and how sensitive these factors are relative to each segment of\nthe population. Our approach addresses critical gaps in localized data necessary\nfor informed decision-making, particularly at the neighborhood or sub-city level\nwhere many interventions are typically implemented. The insights provided by\nthis study are invaluable for municipalities seeking to understand and manage the\nrapidly evolving patterns and trends in travel behavior. A crucial benefit of this\napproach is that it is not data intensive, and it could easily be tailored to address\nniche populations.\n\nWe showcase our approach using a demo webpage https://seattle-travel.\nreplit.app/ that provides an overview of how small area estimates are generated\nusing Seattle as a case study. Though the demonstration site is on transportation,\nthe approach could easily be extended to multiple domain areas. The webpage\npresents estimated travel mode choices, destinations, trip volume and routes in a\ngiven period at the Census Block Group (CBG) level for Seattle, thus providing\ncrucial insights that could be localized to specific geographical areas, and for de-\nsigning targeted policy responses. Our research offers more reliable and actionable\ninsights and provides results at a level that makes it practical for city planners,\nmunicipal governments, and community-based organizations to track and respond\nto local trends effectively, ultimately fostering better-targeted interventions.\n\n2\n\n\f2 Literature Review\n\nExisting Works\n\nRecent advances in transportation research highlight the complex interplay between\nthe built environment, travel patterns, traffic dynamics, zoning ordinances, and land\nuse policies. This progress is characterized by the integration of diverse methodolo-\ngies and a growing emphasis on data-driven approaches, which provide increasingly\ndetailed and nuanced insights for small geographic areas.\n\nA rich body of literature has consistently documented the profound influence of\nurban form and individual travel patterns on overall mobility. Stead and Marshall\n[2001] provided a foundational understanding of how different urban layouts influ-\nence travel behaviors, including mode choice and trip frequency. This viewpoint\nis further complemented by studies such as Goulet-Langlois et al. [2017], which\nmeasures the regularity of individual travel patterns using intelligent transporta-\ntion system (ITS) data, and Peirce and Lappin [2003], that explores how real-time\ntraveler information impacts travel decisions . These works collectively emphasize\nthe importance of both static urban design factors and dynamic information flows\nin shaping travel choices, establishing the groundwork for more adaptive planning\nmodels.\n\nThe application of machine learning has significantly transformed the field of\ntransportation research, offering sophisticated tools for analyzing and predicting\ntravel behaviors and traffic patterns. Gong et al. [2018] and Hagenauer and Helbich\n[2017] exemplify this by showcasing the use of machine learning to identify trip pur-\nposes and model travel mode choices, respectively, thereby enhancing the accuracy\nof travel behavior analysis . Machine learning\u2019s capacity for handling non-linear\nrelationships and complex interactions has proven invaluable for capturing the nu-\nanced factors influencing human travel behavior, moving beyond the limitations of\ntraditional linear models.\n\nConcurrently, network theory and advanced mathematical frameworks have been\nincreasingly applied to traffic analysis. Sol\u00b4e-Ribalta et al. [2016] utilized network\ntheory to identify congestion hotspots, while Hu et al. [2022] and Zhang et al. [2022]\nleveraged complex network information for traffic flow prediction. This interdisci-\nplinary approach integrates sophisticated mathematical frameworks, such as Hodge\ntheory in Jiang et al. [2011], Lim [2020], and Aoki et al. [2022], providing a com-\nprehensive understanding of urban spatial structures and traffic dynamics . These\ntheoretical advancements offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of\nurban mobility, providing a more rigorous foundation for developing innovative so-\nlutions in transportation planning and management.\n\nIdentified Gaps\n\nDespite significant advancements in transportation research, a synthesis of existing\nworks reveals several critical gaps that limit the comprehensiveness and actionable\nutility of current models. Addressing these limitations is paramount for developing\ntruly effective and responsive urban planning strategies.\n\nOne notable gap lies in the insufficient integration of static urban design factors\nwith dynamic real-time data. While the impact of urban form on travel patterns is\nwell-established, there remains a need to seamlessly integrate these static elements\nwith real-time data acquisition, as explored by Stead and Marshall [2001] and Peirce\nand Lappin [2003]. Future research is necessary to create adaptive urban planning\nmodels that effectively combine these influences, enhancing the responsiveness of\nurban infrastructure to changing travel behaviors.\n\nA second limitation is the lack of comprehensive models for individual travel\npatterns. Although progress has been made in understanding individual travel\nregularity by Goulet-Langlois et al. [2017] and trip purposes by Gong et al. [2018],\na void exists in developing truly comprehensive models that integrate individuals\u2019\ntravel behavior with broader urban influences and real-time data. Such models\nare crucial for capturing the full spectrum of factors influencing individual travel\ndecisions.\n\nA third critical gap relates to the translation of advanced predictive models into\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Panoramic Chart with Four Step Travel Demand Model\n\nprescriptive solutions. Advanced machine learning and network theory applications\nfrom Hagenauer and Helbich [2017], Hu et al. [2022], and Zhang et al. [2022] have\nprimarily focused on predictive modeling and traffic analysis. However, further\ndevelopment is needed to move beyond mere prediction to prescribing solutions\nfor optimizing travel patterns and reducing congestion through proactive urban\nplanning and policy-making.\n\nThese shortcomings are what informed the present study. What we are propos-\ning introduces a groundbreaking small-area estimation framework that bridges crit-\nical gaps in urban transportation planning by integrating urban design with dy-\nIt\nnamic real-time data and developing comprehensive individual-level models.\nuses publicly available microdata and machine learning to predict travel behavior\nfor synthetic populations at fine geographic scales such as census block groups,\naddressing the \u201dresolution gap\u201d of traditional, coarse-grained models. While not\nexplicitly focused on environmental outcomes, the framework implicitly contributes\nto understanding environmental and behavioral linkages by providing granular data\nthat can inform tailored interventions and be fed into emissions estimation tools.\nFurthermore, the research moves beyond mere prediction to offer prescriptive so-\nlutions, enabling city planners to analyze scenarios, anticipate impacts, and im-\nplement targeted interventions for optimized travel patterns and reduced conges-\ntion. Crucially, the study prioritizes ethical considerations by employing synthetic\npopulations, which provide the benefits of highly detailed individual-level data for\naccurate modeling while safeguarding personal privacy.\n\n3 Empirical Framework\n\nThe project\u2019s empirical framework, while borrowing heavily from the the clas-\nsical Four-Step structure, demonstrates a significant evolution beyond its tradi-\ntional, highway-centric origins. The methodologies and data sources employed,\nsuch as OpenStreetMap (OSM) for network data, General Transit Feed Specifi-\ncation (GTFS) for transit information, and the Puget Sound Regional Council\u2019s\n(PSRC) highlight a sophisticated adaptation. This shows that our approach, illus-\ntrated using Seattle as the testbed, is not a rigid application of the 1950s paradigm\nbut a contemporary, advanced iteration that incorporates multimodal travel and a\nmore nuanced understanding of traveler behavior, moving towards activity-based\nprinciples within the established framework. This procedural approach significantly\nenhances its relevance for addressing complex modern urban planning challenges,\nincluding traffic congestion, environmental sustainability, and equitable access to\ntransportation.\n\n4\n\n\f3.1 Data and Data Sources\n\nThe FSTM, a framework that was developed in the 1950s primarily for for highway\nplanning [McNally, 2000] represents the seminal empirical model for transportation\nforecasting. Over the decades, this foundational model has undergone significant\nevolution, expanding its scope in the 1970s and 1980s to encompass multimodal trips\nand integrate more sophisticated modeling techniques. This continuous adaptation\nunderscores its enduring role as a ubiquitous tool for establishing a critical link\nbetween land use patterns and travel behavior, thereby informing comprehensive\ntransportation planning efforts.\n\nTransportation\nmension\n\nTrip Generation\n\nOD Distribution\n\nRoute Assignment\n\nMode Choice\n\nDi-\n\nCore\nData\n\nPSRC\n\nLODES\n\nOSM\n\nGTFS\n\nSource\n\nCore Methodology\n\nTree-based Predictive ML\n\nEntropy-based Gravity Model\n\nDijkstra\u2019s Algorithm\n\nBayesian Methods\n\nSyntetic Population\n\nACS/PUMS\n\nIterative Proportional Fitting\n\nTable 1 provides a high-level description of the transportation dimensions being\nanalyzed and for each, the core methodology utilized and the primary data used.\nMore information on the datasets is provided below.\n\nData Source\nPSRC Data\n\nURL / Citation\nPuget Sound Regional\nCouncil [2025]\n\nLODES Data\n\nU.S. Census Bureau\n[2022]\n\nOpenStreetMap\n(OSM)\n\nOpenStreetMap Con-\ntributors [2025]\n\nGTFS Data\n\nGoogle LLC [2025]\n\nACS / PUMS\n\nUnited States.

Subsequently, representative households\nand persons are sampled directly from PUMS files. PUMS files contain disaggregate\nrecords for persons and households, which can be linked to provide a comprehensive\nmicrodata foundation.\n\nThe process of synthetic population generation bridges aggregate data to disag-\ngregate behavior. While Census data provides aggregate distributions of population\ncharacteristics, PUMS offers the underlying microdata for individual households and\npersons. Synthetic population generation, particularly through techniques like It-\nerative Proportional Fitting (IPF), acts as the critical link, allowing the creation\nof a full, disaggregate population that statistically matches the known aggregate\ncontrols. This enables the fundamental shift from modeling abstract \u201dtrips\u201d to sim-\nulating the nuanced \u201dtravel choices of households and persons\u201d. This capability\nallows the Seattle model to capture behavioral heterogeneity and individual-level\nnuances that aggregate models inherently miss. Instead of assuming average travel\nbehavior for an entire census tract, the model can simulate how distinct household\ntypes (e.g., single-person, multi-generational families, varying income brackets) and\nindividual characteristics (e.g., age, worker status, vehicle availability) make dif-\nferent travel decisions. This leads to a richer, more realistic simulation of urban\nmobility, which is essential for predicting \u201dtravel trails for each type of individual\u201d\nas specified in the user query.\n\nMachine Learning for Trip Count Prediction Trip generation constitutes\nthe initial phase in the conventional four-step transportation forecasting, primarily\nfocusing on predicting the number of trips each type of socio-demographic individual\nwould make.\n\nThe application of machine learning for trip count prediction leverages ML\u2019s\ncapacity for non-linearity and behavioral complexity. Traditional trip generation\nmodels, such as linear regression or cross-classification, inherently assume linear\nrelationships or fixed categorical influences. However, human travel behavior is a\nhighly complex and non-linear phenomenon, influenced by a multitude of interacting\nsocioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors. Machine learning models,\nparticularly ensemble tree-based methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)\nand deep learning architectures, are uniquely adept at identifying and capturing\nthese intricate, non-linear relationships and complex interactions without requir-\ning explicit prior assumptions about their functional forms (Breiman [2001]). By\nleveraging ML for trip count prediction, the Seattle model can achieve significantly\nhigher accuracy and greater behavioral realism in its foundational trip estimates.\n\nNetwork Model for Census Block Groups and Travel Trail Prediction\nThe integration of predicted trip counts proceeds as follows: the output from the\ntrip generation phase (predicted trip counts or trip ends) serves as the primary input\nfor the trip distribution step, which then matches trip origins with their respective\ndestinations. This process culminates in the creation of origin-destination (O-D)\nmatrices, typically categorized by trip purpose.\nIn this study, an entropy-based\ngravity model is employed for O-D pairing (Wilson [1970]). This model, rooted in\nthe principle of maximizing the uncertainty of the trip distribution subject to known\nconstraints (total productions, total attractions, and total travel cost), provides a\nstatistically sound method for estimating the most probable distribution of trips\nbetween all possible origin-destination pairs. This macro-level approach effectively\nconnects the \u201dpredicted count of trips from the ML model\u201d (derived from the trip\n\n6\n\n\fgeneration phase) with the network characteristics, generating a comprehensive\nmatrix of travel demand between all TAZs. These O-D demands are subsequently\nassigned to the traffic network in the \u201dtraffic assignment\u201d step, which determines\nthe routes travelers choose.\n\nThe \u201dPredicted Travelling Trail for Each Type of Individual\u201d in this context\nrefers to the outcome of the trip assignment (or route assignment) phase, where\nthe previously determined Origin-Destination (O-D) demands are allocated onto\nthe specific links of the network. For each O-D pair, Dijkstra\u2019s shortest path algo-\nrithm is employed to determine the optimal \u201dtravel trail\u201d or route within the urban\ntraffic network. Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm efficiently identifies the path with the mini-\nmum accumulated impedance (e.g., travel time, distance, cost) between two nodes\nin a graph (Dijkstra [1959]). This step is crucial for understanding how travelers\nactually utilize the infrastructure.\n\nBayesian Methods for Travel Method Analysis and Refinement Mode\nchoice is a complex decision influenced by a wide array of factors, including traveler\ncharacteristics (e.g., age, gender, income, driver\u2019s license status, vehicle availabil-\nity), modal availability and characteristics (e.g., in-vehicle time, walk/access time,\ninitial wait time, number of transfers, fare, parking cost), journey characteristics\n(e.g., time of day, presence of stops on a tour), and land use characteristics (e.g.,\npopulation density, employment density, measures of mixed land use density, inter-\nsection density).\n\nThe application of Bayesian methods to determine probabilities of different\ntransportation methods signifies a move beyond simple deterministic predictions\n(e.g., \u201dX trips will use transit\u201d) to a more nuanced, probabilistic understanding of\nmode choice. Bayesian methods are inherently suited for this, as they naturally\nintegrate and quantify uncertainty in their predictions. This contrasts sharply with\nmany traditional models that provide a single \u201dbest\u201d estimate without indicating\nthe confidence level. For transportation planners in Seattle, this translates into a\nrisk-informed decision-making framework. Instead of relying on a single predicted\nvalue, they receive a distribution of probabilities.\n\n4 Analytical Setup\n\n4.1\n\nIterative Proportional Fitting Method\n\nThe Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) method allows us to generate a synthetic\nmicro-population for each CBG by aligning sample microdata (PUMS) with known\nmarginal distributions (ACS). Our synthetic individuals are characterized by a set\nof five binary features known to influence travel:\n\n\u2022 household car share: Whether household owns at least one car.\n\n\u2022 individual senior : Whether the person is 65 years or older.\n\n\u2022 household income high: Whether household income is \u2265 $100K.\n\n\u2022 individual employed : Whether the person is currently employed.\n\n\u2022 individual college: Whether the person has a college degree or higher.\n\nEach individual is thus uniquely positioned within the socio-demographic and spa-\ntial landscape of Seattle, enabling heterogeneous travel behavior simulation.\n\nWith original data matrix M and marginal sum in n dimensions (u1, u2, ..., un),\nthe Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) algorithm could be performed to generate\nsynthesized data N .\n\nAfter scaling, the final result is a matrix containing decimal numbers, which\nmust be integerized since the population should be represented as integers. The\nintegerization process is crucial to maintain the discrete nature of the population\ncount, and it is typically achieved using appropriate rounding or truncation meth-\nods. By integerizing the values, the results will be consistent with the expected\nwhole-number population representation.\n\n7\n\n\fAlgorithm 1 IPF(M, u, \u03f5)\n\nInput M: original matrix; (u1, u2, ..., uD): marginal sum in each dimension\n\n\u03f5: error tolerance\n\nOutput N: generated matrix\n\n1: N = empty array with same shape as M\n2: \u03b4 = Euclidean distance between N and M\n3: while \u03b4 > \u03f5 do\n4:\n\nfor d in number of dimension of M do\n\n5:\n6:\n\nd sums = sum of each unit of M in dimension d\nfor each element in N (represented as N[i,j,...,k,...], where k is the ordinal\n\nin dimension d) do\n\nN[i,j,...,k,...] = M[i,j,...,k,...] * ud[k] / d sums[k]\n\n7:\n8:\nend for\n9:\n10: end while\n\nend for\n\n4.2 Four-Step Modeling Framework\n\n4.2.1 Trip Generation\n\nTo predict travel volume based on demographic factors, several machine learning\nmodels are employed, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, Gradient Boost-\ning, and Deep Learning. These models utilize one-hot encoding to represent ten dif-\nferent household and individual-level features from the PSRC dataset. The machine\nlearning models used in this study can be mathematically represented as follows:\n\n\u2022 Linear Regression:\n\nY = \u03b20 +\n\nn\n(cid:88)\n\n\u03b2iXi + \u03f5\n\ni=1\nwhere \u03b20 is the intercept, \u03b2i are the coefficients for each feature Xi, and \u03f5 is\nthe error term.\n\n\u2022 Random Forest:\n\n\u02c6Y =\n\nT\n(cid:88)\n\nft(X)\n\n1\nT\n\nt=1\nwhere T is the number of trees, and ft represents the prediction of the t-th\ndecision tree.\n\n\u2022 Gradient Boosting:\n\n\u02c6Y =\n\nM\n(cid:88)\n\nm=1\n\n\u03b3mhm(X)\n\nwhere M is the number of boosting stages, \u03b3m is the learning rate, and hm\nrepresents the weak learner at stage m.\n\n\u2022 Deep Learning:\n\n\u02c6Y = f (W, X)\n\nwhere f is the deep neural network function with weights W and input fea-\ntures X.\n\nTo assess feature importance, we use models like Random Forest and Gradient\nBoosting. The importance of a feature in a Random Forest model, for example, can\nbe quantified by the mean decrease in impurity (Gini importance) or permutation\nimportance. Gradient Boosting models often use similar metrics to determine the\ninfluence of each feature on the prediction outcome.\n\nThe project also employs SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to un-\nderstand the contribution of each factor towards predicting travel volume. SHAP\nvalues provide a unified measure of feature importance by distributing the predic-\ntion difference fairly among the features, based on Shapley values from cooperative\ngame theory.\n\n8\n\n\fMathematically, SHAP values are calculated as:\n\n\u03d5i =\n\n(cid:88)\n\nS\u2286{1,...,n}\\{i}\n\n|S|!(n \u2212 |S| \u2212 1)!\nn!\n\n[f (S \u222a {i}) \u2212 f (S)]\n\nwhere \u03d5i is the SHAP value for feature i, S is a subset of all features excluding i,\nf (S) is the model prediction for the subset S, and n is the total number of features.\nThis ensures that each feature\u2019s contribution is fairly attributed, considering all\npossible combinations of features.\n\nIn Figure 2, we observe the importance of different features across various ma-\nchine learning models. SHAP values illustrate how each factor\u2019s significance varies\ndepending on the specific prediction scenario. This detailed analysis of feature im-\nportance is crucial for understanding the underlying drivers of travel volume and\naids in making informed decisions regarding transportation policies and infrastruc-\nture planning.\n\nFigure 2: Feature cross correlation and importance analysis\n\n4.2.2 Trip Distribution\n\nTrip distribution estimates the number of trips between origin-destination (OD)\npairs, forming the essential bridge between trip generation and route assignment.\nOne widely adopted analytical approach for trip distribution is the gravity model,\nwhich draws conceptual inspiration from Newtonian physics while being grounded\nin statistical mechanics through entropy maximization. From a transportation sys-\ntems perspective, the entropy-maximizing formulation offers a principled framework\nthat balances trip productions, trip attractions, and travel impedance in a proba-\nbilistically optimal manner.\n\nMathematically, the objective is to determine the trip matrix {Tij} that maxi-\nmizes the overall entropy of the system, reflecting the number of possible microstates\n(i.e., trip configurations) consistent with observed constraints. The entropy function\nis defined as:\n\n(cid:88)\n\nS = \u2212\n\nTij ln Tij,\n\nsubject to the marginal constraints:\n\ni,j\n\n(cid:88)\n\nj\n\nTij = Oi,\n\n(cid:88)\n\ni\n\nTij = Dj,\n\nand optionally a cost constraint or impedance function that penalizes long-distance\ntrips. By applying the method of Lagrange multipliers, the resulting optimal solu-\ntion yields the familiar doubly-constrained gravity model form:\n\nTij = AiBjOiDjf (cij),\n\nwhere f (cij) is a deterrence function that decreases with travel cost cij, and Ai, Bj\nare balancing factors ensuring that the marginal constraints are satisfied. Common\nchoices for the deterrence function include exponential decay f (cij) = e\u2212\u03b2cij and\n\n9\n\n\fpower functions f (cij) = c\u2212\u03b3\nfrom data.\n\nij , where \u03b2 and \u03b3 are impedance parameters estimated\n\nThis entropy-based interpretation not only provides a statistical underpinning to\nthe gravity model but also facilitates the incorporation of additional constraints or\npolicy levers, such as congestion pricing, accessibility thresholds, or socioeconomic\nfactors. Its widespread adoption in metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs)\nand regional modeling frameworks is attributed to its analytical tractability, in-\nterpretability, and empirical robustness. Moreover, the entropy maximization per-\nspective aligns naturally with emerging data sources (e.g., mobile phone records,\nGPS traces) by allowing model calibration using maximum likelihood or Bayesian\nupdating techniques. As such, it remains a cornerstone methodology for estimating\nplausible OD matrices under constrained conditions, particularly in the absence of\nfully observed trip-level data.\n\n4.2.3 Route Assignment\n\nRoutes for each origin-destination (OD) pair are determined using Dijkstra\u2019s short-\nest path algorithm applied to a multimodal transportation graph composed of\nroad links, walking paths, and GTFS-derived transit edges. This unified network\nstructure allows seamless modeling of complex travel behaviors, including walk-to-\ntransit and intermodal transfers. Edge weights are defined in terms of generalized\nimpedance, which may include travel time, transfer penalties, wait times, and real-\ntime congestion adjustments when available. This enables flexible simulation of\nrealistic multimodal flows and link-level load estimations.\n\nDijkstra\u2019s algorithm is a fundamental and well-established method for solving\nthe single-source shortest path problem in graphs with non-negative edge weights.\nIt incrementally builds the shortest path tree by repeatedly selecting the node with\nthe smallest known tentative distance from the source, updating the distances of its\nneighbors, and finalizing nodes whose minimum paths are guaranteed. Its correct-\nness and determinism make it a reliable foundation for routing under general cost\nmetrics. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\nAlgorithm 2 Dijkstra(Graph, source)\n\nInput Graph: a weighted graph with nodes and edges; source: starting node\nOutput dist[]: shortest distance from source to all nodes; prev[]: previous node\n\nin optimal path\n\n1: Initialize dist[source] = 0\n2: for each node v in Graph do\nif v \u0338= source then\n3:\ndist[v] = \u221e\n\nend if\nprev[v] = undefined\n\n4:\n5:\n6:\n7: end for\n8: Q = all nodes in Graph (min-priority queue based on dist[])\n9: while Q is not empty do\n10:\n11:\n12:\n13:\n14:\n15:\n\nu = node in Q with smallest dist[u]\nremove u from Q\nfor each neighbor v of u do\n\nalt = dist[u] + weight(u, v)\nif alt \u00a1 dist[v] then\ndist[v] = alt\nprev[v] = u\n\n16:\n17:\nend for\n18:\n19: end while\n\nend if\n\nThe algorithm yields the shortest paths from the source to all reachable nodes,\nwhich can then be traced using the prev[] mapping. Within a multimodal urban\nnetwork, the edge weights weight(u, v) may include static or dynamic impedance\nterms such as congested travel times, walk speeds, transit headways, and transfer\ncosts. This generality makes the algorithm particularly well-suited for the task.\n\n10\n\n\fFor small to medium-sized networks, such as district-scale simulations, Dijkstra\u2019s\nalgorithm is computationally efficient and scalable, especially when paired with\nappropriate data structures like binary heaps or adjacency lists.\n\n4.2.4 Mode Choice\n\nThe Naive Bayesian approach provides a robust statistical framework for under-\nstanding the probabilities associated with different transportation modes based on\ndemographic data and other relevant factors.\n\nThe Naive Bayesian Classifier simplifies the computation by assuming that the\ndemographic features are conditionally independent given the transportation mode.\nThis assumption, although often violated in practice, allows for efficient and effective\ncomputation. The fundamental equation of the Naive Bayesian classifier in our\ncontext is expressed as:\n\nP (T |D1, D2, . . . , Dn) \u221d P (T ) \u00b7\n\nn\n(cid:89)\n\ni=1\n\nP (Di|T )\n\nwhere T represents the transportation mode (e.g., transit, drive, walk), and Di\n\nrepresents individual demographic attributes such as race, sex, income, etc.\n\nThe steps for implementing the Naive Bayesian Classifier in our transportation\n\nmode prediction are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Compute Prior P (T ): We start by calculating the prior probabilities for each\n\ntransportation mode from the training dataset:\n\nP (T ) =\n\nNumber of trips using mode T\nTotal number of trips\n\n\u2022 Estimate Likelihood P (Di|T ): For each demographic attribute Di, we esti-\n\nmate the likelihood of observing Di given transportation mode T :\n\nP (Di|T ) =\n\nNumber of individuals with Di using mode T\nTotal number of individuals using mode T\n\n\u2022 Calculate Posterior P (T |D): Using the computed prior and likelihood, we\ncalculate the posterior probability for each transportation mode given the\ndemographic data:\n\nP (T |D1, D2, . . . , Dn) \u221d P (T ) \u00b7\n\nn\n(cid:89)\n\ni=1\n\nP (Di|T )\n\n\u2022 Mode Choice Prediction: The transportation mode with the highest posterior\nprobability is selected as the predicted mode for the given demographic profile:\n\n\u02c6T = arg max\n\nT\n\nP (T |D1, D2, . . . , Dn)\n\nWe validate our Naive Bayesian Classifier by comparing the predicted mode\nchoices with the actual mode choices from ground truth data. This comparison\nprovides insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model. The Bayesian\nmodel\u2019s predictions enable better decision-making regarding transportation policies\nand infrastructure. By understanding the probabilistic relationships between demo-\ngraphics and transportation modes, policymakers can design targeted interventions\nto improve the efficiency and equity of transportation systems. The model\u2019s ca-\npability to integrate diverse data sources and produce granular predictions at the\ncensus block group level further enhances its utility for urban planning and policy\nformulation.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 3: Input Boxes in Our Website\n\nFigure 4: Result Outputs Once Clicked \u2019Predict\u2019\n\n5 Evaluation and Results\n\nReal-time Visualization and User Interface\n\nThis project presents an analytical framework, manifested as a user-friendly web\ninterface, to explore and predict individual travel behaviors and transportation\nchoices. By allowing planners and policymakers to input a set of demographic and\nhousehold variables, such as income, car ownership, and personal characteristics like\nage and education level, the system simulates and reveals latent mobility patterns.\nAt its core, the application employs a series of predictive models trained on extensive\nregional transportation data to sequentially infer a person\u2019s monthly trip volume,\nidentify probable destinations, and, most critically, calculate the likelihood of differ-\nent travel modes\u2014such as driving, public transit, or walking\u2014for each journey. The\nvisual output, including a map-based representation of potential routes and a clear\nbreakdown of modal probabilities, provides a powerful tool for understanding how\nsocioeconomic factors and spatial relationships influence human movement. This\napproach shifts the focus from simple data reporting to an interactive predictive\nanalysis, empowering stakeholders to gain data-driven insights into urban mobility\ndynamics and to make more informed decisions regarding transportation policy,\ninfrastructure investment, and sustainable urban planning.\n\nRobustness and Validation\n\nThe validation process is performed at the \u201dcensus block group level\u201d. ACS/PUMS\ndata, particularly when linked to census block groups, provides rich demographic\nand socioeconomic characteristics. This means that validation is not just about\nassessing overall regional accuracy but critically about evaluating accuracy within\nspecific neighborhoods and for distinct demographic segments. This allows for a de-\ntailed spatial and social assessment of model performance. This granular validation\ncapability allows for the identification of specific census block groups or demographic\ngroups where the model might perform less accurately, thereby highlighting areas\nthat require further data collection, model refinement, or targeted calibration. More\nimportantly, it enables the assessment of whether proposed transportation solutions\n(informed by the model\u2019s predictions) are equitable in their impact across different\ncommunities, directly aligning with the project\u2019s implicit goal of aiding effective\ntransportation planning and policy-making for all residents of Seattle.\n\nTo validate our results, we combine the population of individuals in each census\nblock group and estimate the transportation volume, subsequently comparing these\nestimates with those generated by the baseline approach, which is based on simple\npopulation proportion.\n\nThe naive baseline approach distributes the proportion of individuals using each\n\n12\n\n\fFigure 5: Proportion of Correctly Predicted Census Block Groups\n\ntransportation method uniformly across all census blocks. This method assumes ho-\nmogeneity within every census block group, disregarding variations in demographic\ndistribution, origin-destination patterns, and other critical factors that influence\ntransportation choices. By ignoring these variations, the baseline method provides\na rudimentary and often inaccurate representation of actual transportation volumes.\nIn contrast, our approach accounts for the heterogeneity and spatial nuances of\nthe population, significantly enhancing the accuracy and granularity of transporta-\ntion volume estimates. This is evident in the model\u2019s performance, which outstrips\nthe baseline methods, particularly in detecting low accuracy in transit, drive, and\nwalk modes. The results, illustrated in Figure 5, demonstrate the model\u2019s supe-\nrior capability in capturing the intricacies of travel behavior within diverse urban\nenvironments.\n\nOne of the key strengths of our model is its ability to provide data at a finer\ngranularity, specifically targeting census block groups rather than the broader census\ntracts used in the American Community Survey (ACS). Most existing data sources\nonly offer information at the census block group level, limiting the precision and\napplicability of the data for localized policy and planning purposes. Our approach,\nhowever, breaks down the data into more detailed census block groups, allowing\nfor a more nuanced understanding of transportation patterns and better-informed\ndecision-making.\n\nThe significance of this project\u2019s advancements lies not only in its improved ac-\ncuracy but also in its potential to offer insightful policy implications. By delivering\nmore granular and precise data, the model enables policymakers to identify and ad-\ndress specific transportation challenges within smaller geographic areas. This level\nof detail is particularly valuable for urban planners and local authorities who need\nto design targeted interventions to enhance transportation efficiency and equity.\n\n6 Policy Insights and Conclusions\n\nThe proposed framework offers a flexible and actionable toolset for local govern-\nments, Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), and transit agencies aiming\nto modernize their transportation planning practices. By enhancing the classical\nfour-step model with disaggregated agent-based inputs and a multimodal routing\nengine, the methodology supports a wide array of traffic engineering and policy use\ncases. In terms of infrastructure planning, it enables identification of multimodal\nbottlenecks and high-stress corridors, providing evidence for prioritizing investments\nsuch as dedicated bus lanes, pedestrian safety upgrades, or signal timing improve-\nments. The framework also facilitates equity-aware analysis by allowing planners to\naudit modal access and travel burdens across socio-demographic strata, including\nincome groups, elderly populations, and zero-vehicle households.\n\nA key contribution of this work lies in its ability to detect and quantify travel\ndisadvantage at the population level. By modeling individuals and households ex-\nplicitly, the system surfaces critical spatial and modal mismatches that are often\nobscured in aggregate models. For example, it highlights elderly residents without\naccess to private vehicles living in transit-sparse neighborhoods, low-income workers\nfacing long and multimodal commutes, or communities where affordable housing is\ndisconnected from major employment centers. These findings can inform targeted\n\n13\n\n\finterventions such as the deployment of microtransit services, expansion of transit\ncoverage zones, or development incentives aligned with mobility goals.\n\nIn a broader context, this work demonstrates how traditional transportation\nmodeling can be revitalized through the integration of multi-source datasets, sta-\ntistical estimation techniques, and network-theoretic algorithms. The grounding of\nthe four-step process in synthetic microdata allows planners to reconcile the rigor\nof system-level demand modeling with the nuance of individual mobility needs. As\ntransportation systems continue to evolve toward multimodality, equity, and sus-\ntainability, such granular and adaptive modeling approaches will be increasingly\nvital. This framework provides a pathway to bridge long-standing gaps between\nregional modeling tools and the realities of everyday travel, ultimately supporting\nmore equitable, data-informed, and human-centric urban mobility systems.\n\nReferences\n\nN.

Copyright 2025\nby the author(s).\n\n1\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a pow-\nerful tool for learning graph-structured data in various sci-\nentific domains (including chemistry, biology, physics, and\nmaterials science), achieving remarkable success in ap-\nplications of predicting molecular properties (Kamberaj,\n2022; Chen et al., 2023), modeling protein-protein interac-\ntions (G\u00a8ormez et al., 2021; Ravichandran et al., 2024; Li\net al., 2023), analyzing phase transitions (Qu et al., 2022),\ncharacterizing material characteristics (Hu & Latypov, 2024;\nSheriff et al., 2024; Gurniak et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024),\netc. As GNNs are increasingly applied to critical scientific\nand decision-making tasks, there is a growing need for inter-\npretability and explainability in these models (Zhang et al.,\n2024a). Scientists and practitioners often ask for not only\naccurate predictions, but also insights into why and how\nthese predictions are made. This is particularly crucial in\nscientific applications where understanding the underlying\nmechanisms and causal relationships is as important as the\npredictions themselves.\n\nA recent trend in GNN research focuses on enhancing inter-\npretability by developing methods that identify and visual-\nize the nodes, edges, subgraphs, or features most influential\nor causal for a given prediction. Existing approaches on\nGNN interpretation can be broadly categorized into two\nclasses (Zhang et al., 2024a): post-hoc explainer meth-\nods (Ying et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2020; Schlichtkrull et al.,\n2021; Wu et al., 2023; Bui et al., 2024) and intrinsically\ninterpretable models (Wu et al., 2022; Miao et al., 2022;\nChen et al., 2024). Post-hoc explainer methods analyze a\npre-trained GNN model to generate intuitive explanations.\nThese methods enjoy flexibility and can be integrated into\ndifferent kinds of models. But they might provide explana-\ntions that are suboptimal or inconsistent with the model\u2019s\nactual decision-making processes (Miao et al., 2022). On\nthe other hand, intrinsically interpretable models incorpo-\nrate interpretability directly into the model architecture and\ntraining process. A basic intrinsically interpretable GNN\nmodel is built upon the graph attention (Veli\u02c7ckovi\u00b4c et al.,\n2018) mechanism. But a na\u00a8\u0131ve application of attention\nweights does not give a reliable interpretation for real graph\ndata (Ying et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2021), as attention weights\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nmay not always correlate with actual feature importance.\nMoreover, the trade-off of interpretability and predictive\nperformance (Du et al., 2019) may not be acceptable in real-\nworld applications. To address these challenges, Miao et al.\n(2022) proposed a stochastic attention mechanism (GSAT)\nto use the graph information bottleneck (Wu et al., 2020;\nTishby et al., 1999) as the target function, employ attention\nweights to control the information bottleneck, and sample\nrationale subgraphs using Gumbel-softmax reparameteriza-\ntion. Similarly, Chen et al. (2024) approached interpretation\nby searching for rationale subgraphs within the framework\nof subgraph multilinear extension (SubMT) and proposing\na graph multilinear net (GMT) for better SubMT approxi-\nmation. Wu et al. (2022) proposed Discovering Invariant\nRationales (DIR), applying interventions on training distri-\nbutions to obtain invariant causal rationales while filtering\nout spurious correlations.\n\nDespite these advancements, existing intrinsic methods of-\nten assume either explicitly or implicitly that the subgraph\nrationales are nearly invariant across different instances\nwithin the same category of graphs, even a strong one-to-\none correspondence between subgraph rationales and pre-\ndictions. However, this is overly restrictive and unrealistic\nin many real-world scenarios, where the graph dataset and\nthe downstream tasks exhibit variform subgraph rationales,\nwhich can vary significantly in form, size, and topology,\neven among graphs of the same category. For example, in\nmolecular biology, molecules with the same bioactivity can\nhave different functional groups responsible for that activ-\nity (Patani & LaVoie, 1996; Brown, 2012). An aromatic ring,\na sulfonamide group, or a heterocyclic compound can each\nbe the key substructure leading to the same pharmacological\neffect in different molecules. In social networks, the struc-\ntural reasons for a user to be influential vary significantly.\nAn influential user might have high degree, high between-\nness centrality, or serving as crucial bridge nodes connecting\ndifferent communities. Our observations, supported by ex-\nperiments on a synthetic dataset (see Figure 3 for the results\nand Appendix E for the dataset construction), show that ex-\nisting intrinsically interpretable models struggle with such\nvariability. Models obtained under these assumptions may\nfail to accurately capture the true causal mechanisms under-\nlying the predictions, resulting in unreliable interpretations\nand suboptimal generalization performance.\n\nTo address the above challenges, we propose Topologically\nInterpretable Graph Learning (TOPING), a novel topologi-\ncal approach to intrinsically interpretable GNNs that lever-\nages techniques from topological data analysis to identify\nstable and persistent rationale subgraphs, effectively han-\ndling the variability in subgraph structures. Our method is\ninspired by the concept of persistent homology, originating\nfrom algebraic topology and recently applied to data analy-\nsis and machine learning (Wong & Vong, 2021; Yan et al.,\n\n2021; 2022; Zhao et al., 2020; Immonen et al., 2023; Ye\net al., 2023; Swenson et al., 2020). Persistent homology\nstudies the dynamics of topological invariants over vari-\nous scales through filtrations, allowing us to capture all the\nchanges and persistence of topological features in the data.\n\nBased on this foundation, we introduce a new perspective on\nthe rationale subgraph identification problem. We model the\ngraph attention mechanism as an underlying graph genera-\ntion process, which ideally constructs the rationale subgraph\nfirst, followed by the addition of auxiliary structures. We\nuse tools from persistent homology to capture and track\nthe representations and life cycles of topological features\nduring the generating process. To effectively distinguish\nthe rationale subgraph from the complement subgraph, we\noptimize the parameterized generation procedure to enhance\nthe stability of the rationale subgraph. Specifically, our goal\nis to amplify the topological differences between the ratio-\nnale subgraph and the complement subgraph, creating a\npersistent gap in their topological features throughout the\ngeneration process. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel\nself-adjusting topological constraint, topological discrep-\nancy, which measures the statistical difference between two\ngraphs with respect to their topological structures. Topolog-\nical discrepancy serves as a metric to quantify how well the\nrationale subgraph is preserved and distinguished from the\ncomplement subgraph during the filtration process. We also\nprovide a tractable approximation of topological discrep-\nancy and provide theoretical guarantees that our models are\nable to achieve ground truth as the unique optimal solution\nunder our loss function.\n\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 We introduce TOPING, a novel intrinsically inter-\npretable GNN framework that incorporates topological\ndata analysis to identify stable rational subgraphs via\npersistent rationale filtration learning. We propose a\nnew loss function, topological discrepancy, to mea-\nsure the statistical difference between two graphs with\nrespect to their topological structures.\n\n\u2022 We provide a tractable approximation of our topolog-\nical discrepancy and provide theoretical guarantees\nthat our models are able to achieve ground truth as\nthe unique optimal solution under our loss function.\nThis establishes a solid theoretical foundation for the\neffectiveness of our approach.\n\n\u2022 We empirically demonstrate that TOPING improves\nexisting methods in both prediction and interpretation\ntasks on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally,\nwe created a synthetic dataset with variform rationale\nsubgraphs to specifically target challenges faced by\nprevious methods. Our results show that TOPING ef-\nfectively handles such variability, confirming its ability\nto address this critical challenge.\n\n2\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nThe concept of rationalization has also been extensively\nstudied in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where\nresearchers identify text spans as rationales for predic-\ntions (Yao et al., 2023; 2024; Gurrapu et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\n2023; 2024; 2025). However, unlike NLP domains where ra-\ntionales are typically contiguous text spans, graph domains\nface the challenge with variform rationale subgraphs that\nvary significantly in size, form, and topology.\n\n2. Preliminaries\n\n2.1. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\n\nGraph neural networks are a class of neural networks de-\nsigned to operate on graph-structured data. A typical\nmessage-passing GNN layer updates node representations\nby aggregating information from neighboring nodes:\n\nh(l+1)\nv\n\n= \u03d5(h(l)\n\nv , AGG(h(l)\n\nu : u \u2208 N (v)))\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h(l)\nv is the message representation of node v at layer\nl, N (v) is the neighborhood of v, AGG is a permutation\ninvariant aggregation function, e.g.: sum, mean, max, and \u03d5\nis a non-linear activation function. Some commonly used\nGNN architectures include Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCN) (Kipf & Welling, 2017), Graph Isomorphism Net-\nworks (GIN) (Xu et al., 2019), Graph Attention Networks\n(GAT) (Veli\u02c7ckovi\u00b4c et al., 2018).\n\n2.2. Intrinsically Interpretable Graph Learning\n\nIntrinsically interpretable graph learning aims to build a\nmodel simultaneously targeting both prediction and inter-\npretability during the training procedure. Formally, given\na collection of labeled graphs (G, Y ) = {(G, yG)}, as-\nsume each graph G is composed of two edge disjoint sub-\ngraphs G = GX \u2294 G\u03f5 with vertex correspondence for some\nGX \u2208 GX and G\u03f5 \u2208 G\u03f5. GX and G\u03f5 are two families of\ngraphs. GX is usually a small finite set. Given a graph G,\nGX \u2286 G is the rationale subgraph that determines the label\nyG, for some unknown oracle h\u2217 : G \u2192 [0, 1]. G\u03f5 is the\nnoisy or less relevant part of the graph. Both GX and G\u03f5\nare unknown, and they have to be learned from the data.\nThe goal is to predict the label \u02c6yG for each graph G and\nsimultaneously identify its rationale subgraphs GX .\n\n2.3. Topological Data Analysis\n\nTopological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a power-\nful analytical framework across diverse domains, including\nmachine learning, artificial intelligence, and computational\nneuroscience. Within graph representation learning specif-\nically, TDA has demonstrated significant capacity to en-\nhance GNNs through the systematic incorporation of topo-\nlogical features (Hofer et al., 2017; 2019; 2020; Dehmamy\net al., 2019; Carri`ere et al., 2020; Horn et al., 2022; Zhao\n\n3\n\net al., 2020; Carri`ere & Blumberg, 2020; Zhang et al., 2022;\n2024b; Yan et al., 2022; Xin et al., 2023; Mukherjee et al.,\n2024). A particularly effective methodological tool in this\ncontext is persistent homology, which provides a rigorous\nmathematical framework for analyzing the evolution of\ntopological features\u2014such as connected components and\ncycles\u2014throughout a graph\u2019s construction process. This\napproach enables the quantitative analysis of structural pat-\nterns by examining their emergence and persistence across\na parameterized filtration of the graph, effectively capturing\nmulti-scale topological information that can be integrated\ninto a learning framework. We give a brief introduction to\nthe basic concepts of topological data analysis (TDA) and\npersistent homology. For a more detailed introduction, we\nrefer readers to (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010; Dey & Wang,\n2022).\n\nGraph Filtration: For an edge-weighted graph G =\n(V, E, f : E \u2192 R), we can create a sequence of nested\nsubgraphs called a graph filtration. For example, assume\nthe edge weight f is normalized, f (E) \u2286 [0, 1], and repre-\nsents some \u201cimportance scores\u201d of edges. We construct a\ngraph filtration F(G) := {G\u2264t | t \u2208 1 \u2212 f (E)} where G\u2264t\nis the subgraph on edges e with 1 \u2212 f (e) \u2264 t. Essentially,\nsuch graph filtration shows how the graph grows as edges\nare included in the decreasing order of importance scores.\n\nOn a graph filtration, one can track all the connected compo-\nnents and cycles appearing and disappearing (merged with\nothers) during the process. If we encode the lifecycle (birth,\ndeath) of each component or cycle as an interval on the real\nline, it turns out that there is an essentially unique way to\nrepresent such information as a multi-set of intervals which\nis topologically stable and equivalent to a well-studied alge-\nbraic structure studied in topological data analysis, known\nas persistent homology. To understand this formally, we\nfirst introduce homology vector spaces and then build up to\npersistent homology.\n\nHomology Space: For a given graph G, we consider homol-\nogy vector spaces over the finite field F2 = {0, 1} (homol-\nogy spaces in brief). The 0-th homology H0(G) is defined\nas the vector space with basis corresponding to all connected\ncomponents of G. The 1-st homology H1(G) is the vector\nspace defined on the set of all cycles in G, with addition\noperation defined as the symmetric difference of cycles. The\nzero vector in H1(G) is the empty cycle. This vector space\nis also called the cycle space and its basis is known as cycle\nbasis, which is well studied in graph theory (Horton, 1987;\nKavitha et al., 2009; Jungnickel, 2007). For example, for a\ngraph G = (V, E = \u2205) with no edges, the 0-th homology\nH0(G) = {0, 1}|V | is a |V |-dimensional vector space with\nbasis being the set of all isolated vertices, while H1(G) = 0\nis trivial since there are no cycles.\n\nPersistent Homology: Starting from a graph filtration F(G)\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nFigure 1. An overview of TOPING. A GNN parameterized by f\u03d5 is used to learn a filtration, from which we sample the subgraphs GX\nand G\u03f5. These subgraphs yield topological features through their respective filtrations F. Meanwhile, the combined subgraph GX \u2294 G\u03f5 is\nprocessed by the same GNN (sharing parameters with f\u03d5) to produce a graph feature. Finally, the topological features T (which capture\nglobal structural information) are combined with the graph feature to form the final graph representation for classification tasks.\n\ngiven by the reversed order of edge weights:\n\nF(G) : \u2205 \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 G\u2264t1 \u2286 G\u2264t2 \u2286 G\u2264t3 \u2286 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2286 G,\n\nif we apply the p-homology functor Hp to the graph fil-\ntration, each subgraph G\u2264t is mapped to a p-th homology\nvector space Hp(G\u2264t). Each inclusion G\u2264t \u2286 G\u2264t\u2032 natu-\nrally induces a linear map Hp(G\u2264t) \u2192 Hp(G\u2264t\u2032). In this\nway, we get a chain of homology vector spaces Hp(F(G))\nconnected by linear maps:\n\n0 \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 Hp(G\u2264t1) \u2192 Hp(G\u2264t2) \u2192 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2192 Hp(G).\n\nSuch structure Hp(F(G)) is called the p-th persistent ho-\nmology of the graph filtration F(G). In this work, we only\nfocus on persistent homologies with p = 0, 1, which respec-\ntively correspond to the lifecycles of connected components\nand cycle bases of the graph filtration. This algebraic struc-\nture is in fact a graded module over the polynomial ring\nF2[t] (Zomorodian & Carlsson, 2004). By the structure the-\norem of finitely generated modules over a principal ideal\ndomain, Hp(F(G)) can be uniquely decomposed into a di-\nrect sum of cyclic modules. Each indecomposable cyclic\nmodule is determined by a pair of numbers (t1, t2), which\nessentially corresponds to the lifecycle of one persistent\ntopological feature. The multiset of all such pairs is called\nthe persistence diagram of the graph filtration, or equiva-\nlently, it can be viewed as a multiset of intervals, which\nis known as the persistent barcode of the graph filtration.\nThe persistent barcode (also equivalently the persistence\ndiagram) is a complete discrete invariant of the persistent\nhomology, which means it fully encodes all topological fea-\ntures represented by the persistent homology (Zomorodian\n& Carlsson, 2004). We refer readers to (Edelsbrunner &\n\nHarer, 2010; Zomorodian & Carlsson, 2004; Ghrist, 2008)\nfor further details about persistent homology.\n\nRemark 2.1. In this work, one can treat the persistent homol-\nogy as a topologically stable representation on a sequential\ninput. The representation is differentiable and encodes the\nevolutions of topological features. See Figure 2 as an ex-\nample of a graph filtration (cubes on the top line) and its\npersistent homology (the multiset of intervals shown as hor-\nizontal lines in the bottom). We will revisit this example\nlater after our method is introduced.\n\nComparing Topological Features: One can compare two\nedge-weighted graphs by computing distances between the\npersistent homologies of their corresponding graph filtra-\ntions. A commonly used (pseudo-)metric is the bottleneck\ndistance dB (Definition B.1 in Appendix B). Recall that per-\nsistent homology can be represented as a multiset of points\nin R2. The bottleneck distance is essentially a variant of the\nWasserstein distance between these two multisets (persis-\ntence diagrams) under the \u2113\u221e-norm. A crucial property of\nthe bottleneck distance is its stability: small perturbations in\nthe input data (e.g., edge weights) lead to small changes in\nthe bottleneck distance, ensuring robustness in downstream\napplications (see Appendix B for more details). Our pro-\nposed topological discrepancy is constructed based on the\nbottleneck distance and its stability property.\n\n3. Method of TOPING\n\nIn the following context, for a given G, we denote the ora-\ncle rationale subgraph and its complement as G\u2217\nX and G\u2217\n\u03f5\nrespectively. We use GX and G\u03f5 to represent a candidate ra-\ntionale subgraph and its complement respectively predicted\n\n4\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nFigure 2. The top row is a learned graph filtration on an example graph through our method. Red and yellow points correspond to ground\ntruth rationale subgraph G\u2217\n\u03f5 respectively. Each snapshot is a subgraph of G on edges with filtration values greater\nthan a decreasing threshold value indicated on top of each snapshot. Below each subgraph, the number in small box is the size of cycle\nbasis for the current subgraph, which equals to the dimension of the cycle space, also known as the 1st betti number. The bottom part\nshows the 1st persistent homology. Each horizontal bar corresponds to a topological feature (basic cycle).\n\nX and noisy subgraph G\u2217\n\nby our model.\n\nIn contrast to existing methods, we re-examine the prob-\nlem from a global perspective through the lens of topology.\nOur central hypothesis is that: if the prediction task is de-\ntermined by a core substructure G\u2217\nX belonging to a small\nfamily of rationale graphs GX , then the full graph G can\nbe viewed as being \u201cgrown\u201d from this core G\u2217\nX by attach-\ning auxiliary structure G\u2217\n\u03f5 . The identification of such core\nrationale substructures is highly non-trivial, as it demands\nconsistency across the generation process and the discovery\nof common topological patterns across the entire dataset.\n\nTo address this, we propose to learn a rationale filtration,\nwhich represents the importance ordering of edges in a\nprocess that simulates an autoregressive generation. By\nlearning to prioritize the edges of the rationale, this approach\nenables us to identify stable and persistent substructures that\nare most relevant for predictions. We target a generating\nprocess for G = (V, E) that ideally generates the critical\nrationale subgraph G\u2217\nX first, followed by a less relevant\ncounterpart G\u2217\n\n\u03f5 , as the complement.\n\nMore precisely, we utilize a backbone GNN as a learn-\nable filtration functional f\u03d5 : G \u2192 [0, 1]|E| that, for each\ngraph, produces a filtration function f G\n\u03d5 : E \u2192 [0, 1] map-\nping edges to their importance score. These scores induce\nan importance ordering on the edges, and consequently, a\ngraph filtration F(G) = {G0, G1, . . . , G|E|}, which is an\nincreasing sequence of subgraphs constructed incrementally\nby adding edges in order of decreasing importance (more\nimportant edges introduced earlier in the sequence). By\ntradition, G0 = \u2205 and G|E| = G. The objective is for the\nlearned filtration functional f\u03d5 to ideally produce a filtration\n\nfunction on edges whose induced importance ordering is to\nbe consistent with the partitioning into G\u2217\n\u03f5 , such\nthat \u2200e \u2208 G\u2217\n\nX and G\u2217\n\n\u03f5 , f (e) > f (e\u2032).\n\nX and e\u2032 \u2208 G\u2217\n\nFor notational conciseness, we omit the super- and sub-\nscripts for f = f G\n\u03d5 and F(G) = F\u03d5(G) when the context\nis clear. We denote F(G\u2264t) to be the filtration of the sub-\ngraphs on edges with filtration values greater than 1 \u2212 t.\nSymmetrically, let F(G\u2265t) be the filtration of the subgraphs\non edges with filtration values smaller than or equal to 1 \u2212 t.\n\nOur approach is founded on ensuring the following property:\n\nPersistent Homology Gap: There is a significant difference\nbetween the topological features derived from two compo-\nnents of a graph\u2019s filtration, F(G\u2264t) and F(G\u2265t), which\nare well separated at some threshold value t \u2208 [0, 1]. The\npersistent homologies computed from these respective parts\nserve as the topological invariants, denoted as TX and T\u03f5.\n\nRemark 3.1. The underlying idea of this property is that,\nwhen considering the generating process of rationale sub-\ngraphs and their irreverent counterparts, their topological\nstructures follow two distinct evolutionary paths. Our meth-\nods are designed to statistically capture such a topologi-\ncal discrepancy. Figure 2 provides a visual illustration of\nour method\u2019s objective when successfully applied. A well-\nlearned graph filtration (top row) assigns higher importance\nscores to edges in the ground-truth rationale subgraph G\u2217\nX .\nAs a result, the 1st persistent homology barcode (bottom\nrow), which tracks the lifecycles of basic cycles, clearly dis-\ntinguishes the topological features of the learned rationale\nGX from those of the complement G\u03f5. The annotation \u201cPer-\nsistent Homology Gap\u201d in the figure exemplifies this desired\nclear separation, where features identified with GX (long\n\n5\n\n+ 5+ 0+ 8+ 8+ 4+ 0+ 0\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfcf+ all the rest0.9750.9900.2260.974~ 0.00.3230.9741.00.0\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf00~ Topological DiscrepancyPersistent Homology Gap > 0.65f(e)>0.999f(e)>0.995f(e)>0.990f(e)>0.975f(e)>0.974f(e)>0.323f(e)>0.226f(e)>=0\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nbars appearing earlier that persist significantly) are distinct\nfrom features associated with G\u03f5 (shorter bars introduced\nlater with shorter persistence). Our topological discrepancy\nmeasure, introduced subsequently, is designed to quantify\nand optimize such a distinguishing topological gap.\n\nProposition 3.3. Given a set of 1-Lipschitz continuous func-\ntions, \u03a8 = {\u03c81, \u03c82, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c8k}, on the space of persistence\ndiagrams, dtopo(P(TX ), P(T\u03f5)) can be lower bounded by:\n\nmax\n\u03c8\u2208\u03a8\n\n| EP \u223cP(TX )[\u03c8(P )] \u2212 EQ\u223cP(T\u03f5)[\u03c8(Q)] |\n\nWe denote the induced probability distributions of persistent\nhomologies as P(TX ) and P(T\u03f5) respectively.\nDefinition 3.2 (Topological Discrepancy). The topological\ndiscrepancy dtopo between P(TX ) and P(T\u03f5) is defined as\n\ndtopo(P(TX ), P(T\u03f5)) \u225c\n\ninf\n\u03c0\u2208\u03a0(P(TX ),P(T\u03f5))\n\nE(P,Q)\u223c\u03c0[dB(P, Q)]\n\nwhere \u03a0(P(TX ), P(T\u03f5)) is the set of all couplings between\nP(TX ) and P(T\u03f5), and dB(P, Q) is the bottleneck distance\n(Definition B.1 in Appendix B) between the persistent ho-\nmologies P and Q.\n\nEssentially, dtopo is the 1-Wasserstein distance between the\ndistributions of persistent homologies TX and T\u03f5 under the\nmetric dB. Now we are ready to introduce the target loss of\nour model based on our topological discrepancy property.\n\nL(\u03d5) = EG [Lce(\u02c6yG, yG)] \u2212 \u03b1Ltopo(P(TX ), P(T\u03f5))\n\n(2)\n\nThe topological constraint term Ltopo is realized by the topo-\nlogical discrepancy dtopo. The prediction loss term Lce is\nthe standard cross-entropy loss between the predicted label\n\u02c6yG and the ground truth label yG. The predicted label \u02c6yG =\nh\u03d5\u03c3f\u03d5(G) is obtained by applying prediction network h\u03d5\non the subgraph GX extracted through \u03c3 from the filtra-\ntion f\u03d5(G). h\u03d5 and f\u03d5 share the same backbone GN N\u03d5\nmodel, which outputs a permutation equivalent representa-\ntion (node or edge representation). f\u03d5 = M LPf \u25e6 GN N\u03d5\napplys a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to get a\n1-dimensional edge representation as the filtration function.\nh\u03d5 = M LPh \u25e6 P ool \u25e6 GN N\u03d5 first pools the permutation\nequivalent presentation of GN N\u03d5 to get a permutation in-\nvariant graph representation, then applys another MLP to\nget the final graph representation for predicting \u02c6yG. Here\nwe omit other details of learnable parameters in the MLP\nfor simplicity. The persistent homologies TX and T\u03f5, as\npermutation invariant graph representations, are also used\nin the final representation M LPh through combining with\nthe graph representation P ool \u25e6 GN N\u03d5. See Figure 1 as a\nhigh-level illustration of the architecture of our model.\n\n3.1. Self-adjusted Topological Constraint\n\nIn this subsection, we will discuss the construction and prop-\nerties of our topological features in details. The original\nconstruction of dtopo is intractable in general. Here we pro-\nvide a tractable lower-bound through Kantorovich duality\nof 1-Wasserstein distance (Villani, 2009) as follows:\n\n6\n\nLearnable Vectorization for the Lower Bound To prac-\ntically compute the lower bound of dtopo, we need a set of\n1-Lipschitz continuous functions \u03a8 = {\u03c81, \u03c82, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c8k}\nthat map persistence diagrams to a Euclidean space where\nexpectations are tractable. TDA offers well-studied vector-\nization methods for this purpose. We adopt the learnable\nvectorization approach from (Hofer et al., 2019), which rep-\nresents persistence diagrams as k-dimensional vectors. This\nis achieved by learning k parameterized kernels, termed\nstructure elements, to capture point distributions on the\ndiagrams. These structure elements are designed to be Lips-\nchitz continuous with some constant C. Specifically, on a\ngiven persistence diagram p, we employ the Rational Hat\nstructure element with learnable center c \u2208 R2 and radius\nr \u2208 R, which is defined as:\n1\n1 + \u2225x \u2212 c\u22252\n\n1\n1+ | |r| \u2212 \u2225x \u2212 c\u22252 |\n\n\u03c6(p; c, r) =\n\n(cid:88)\n\n\u2212\n\nx\u2208p\n\nBy setting \u03c8 = 1\nC \u03c6, we get a 1-Lipschitz continuous repre-\nsentation function as we want. The expectations E[\u03c8(P )]\nare approximated by empirical means over the data in prac-\ntice. To select the maximum in the lower bound formulation,\nin our experiments, instead of a simple softmax, we utilize\na 2-head attention mechanism to identify and sum the top-\n2 maxima from the k vectorized representations. We use\nk = 8 Lipschitz continuous representation functions in our\nexperiments. This learnable vectorization, combined with\nmulti-head attention, not only provides an efficient approx-\nimation of dtopo but also facilitates a self-adjusted focus\non data-dependent topological features. This mechanism\nguides the model to learn the most task-relevant topolog-\nical information, which we found empirically to enhance\ntraining stability and improve performance. All topological\nrepresentations are Lipschitz continuous and differentiable\nalmost everywhere, enabling end-to-end training. Com-\nputations for these representations and their gradients are\nperformed using the codebase from (Zhang et al., 2022).\n\nIn the rest of the paper, we use dtopo to denote the lower\nbound used in practice. Finally, we give the following theo-\nrem to show that our loss L(\u03d5) with dtopo is guaranteed to\nbe optimized by the ground truth.\nTheorem 3.4. Assume \u2200G, |EX | < |E\u03f5|, and G\u2217\nX is min-\nimal with respect to yG in the sense that any subgraph\nGX \u2282 G\u2217\nX losses some information of label, then L(\u03d5) is\n\u03d5(e) = 1{e \u2208 G\u2217\nuniquely optimized by f \u2217\nRemark 3.5. Note that our guarantee does not depend on\nany stability or invariance assumptions on GX , therefore,\n\nX }.\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nit will not be affected by variform rationale subgraphs in\ntheory. The proof is deferred to the appendix C.\n\n3.2. Prior Regularization\n\nAlthough we present theoretical guarantees, in practice, sim-\nply increasing model capacity does not necessarily lead to\nbetter performance, and overfitting may still occur. To miti-\ngate this, we introduce a prior regularization term on f\u03d5 that\nenforces a marginal distribution Pprior over edge filtrations,\nthereby helping stabilize the training procedure:\n(cid:1).\n\n(cid:0)f\u03d5(G), Pprior\n\nL(\u03d5) + \u03b2 Lprior\n\nConcretely, we assume each edge filtration f G\nfollows a two-mixture Gaussian distribution:\n\n\u03d5 \u2208 [0, 1]\n\nPprior = w N (\u00b51, r1) + (1 \u2212 w) N (\u00b52, r2),\n\nwhere w, \u00b51, \u00b52, r1, r2 are parameters. Then we can de-\nfine the prior regularization Lprior via a Kullback\u2013Leibler\n(KL) divergence term augmented with a penalty to prevent\ncollapsing to a single mode:\n\nLprior(f\u03d5(G), Pprior)\n\n=DKL[f\u03d5(G)\u2225Pprior] + \u03b3(r\u22122\n\n1 + r\u22122\n2 )\nlog(Pprior(f\u03d5(G)e)) + \u03b3(r\u22122\n\n1 + r\u22122\n2 )\n\n= \u2212\n\n(cid:88)\n\ne\u2208GE\n\nA key insight is that this two-mixture prior induces a clus-\ntering mechanism on the edge filtrations in [0, 1] for Gx\nand G\u03f5. We note that any choice satisfying |\u00b51 \u2212 \u00b52| > 0\nand a reasonable weighting w \u2208 (0, 1) can still maintain a\nsuitable two-cluster separation on [0, 1]. The exact cluster\ncenters \u00b51, \u00b52 matter less than their separation since the\nedge filtration is learned and used in the topological discrep-\nancy, thanks to the stability property of persistent homology.\nThis approach fundamentally differs from existing methods\nsuch as GSAT (Miao et al., 2022) and GMT (Chen et al.,\n2024), offering greater stability and reduced sensitivity to\nhyperparameter choices. In practice, we simply fix w = 0.5,\n\u00b51 = 0.25, \u00b52 = 0.75, and initialize r1 = r2 = 0.25. We\nalso apply Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization trick (Jang\net al., 2017) used in (Miao et al., 2022) to sample subgraphs.\nRemark 3.6. Although we only talk about edge filtra-\ntions, our methods can be applied to filtrations on nodes,\nedges, or higher-order simplices (faces, tetrahedrons, etc.).\nIn our experiments, we start with the filtration functions\non the nodes and then extend the node filtration to the\nedge filtration by setting f (u, v) = min(f (u), f (v)) or\nmax(f (u), f (v)). This type of filtration is known as upper-\nor lower-star filtration in TDA. It contains less information\nin general since node filtrations can only represent O(|V |)\nmuch \u201cinformation\u201d but edge filtrations can representup to\nO(|E|) = O(|V |2) \u201cinformation\u201d. However, it provides\nmore computational efficiency.\n\n7\n\n3.3. Comparing with Related Works\n\nTwo works most related to ours are DIR (Wu et al., 2022)\nand GSAT (Miao et al., 2022). We briefly compared their\nwork with ours. Compared to DIR, our model also con-\nsiders the distribution of complement graphs of rationale\nsubgraphs, but in a \u201csoft way\u201d. Instead of directly storing\nsample complement subgraphs, our methods can be viewed\nas storing a distribution of topological summary of comple-\nment graphs, which is more efficient. Relative to GSAT, our\nloss can also be seen as a variational lower bound of the GIB\nloss. However, we employ a different prior for the rationale\nsubgraph GX and remove GSAT\u2019s hyperparameter r. Our\ntopological loss acts as a self-adjusted cut, separating GX\nfrom G. In practice, GSAT\u2019s attention can collapse to the\nconstant r if not carefully tuned (Chen et al., 2024). By\ncontrast, our prior performs an unsupervised two-Gaussian\nclustering (akin to k-means), preventing such collapse. Em-\npirically, as long as the two means of Gaussian distributions\nremain distinct, their exact positions have little effect on per-\nformance. Thus, we do not need to tune the hyperparamters,\nand simply fix them at 0.25 and 0.75.\n\n4. Experiments\n\nWe evaluate our proposed method in terms of both inter-\npretability and predictive performance on various bench-\nmark datasets. Our approach, TOPING, demonstrates signif-\nicant advantages over state-of-the-art post-hoc interpretation\nmethods as well as intrinsic interpretable models across al-\nmost all datasets. We will provide a brief introduction to the\ndatasets, baselines, and experiment setups, and leave more\ndetails in the Appendix E.\n\n4.1. Experimental settings\n\nDatasets. We consider eight benchmark datasets com-\nmonly used in the graph explainability literature, catego-\nrized into three types: Single Motif, Multiple Motif, and\nReal Dataset. The first two consist of synthetic datasets.\nSingle Motif includes BA-2Motifs (Luo et al., 2020), BA-\nHouseGrid (Amara et al., 2023), SPmotif0.5 and SPmo-\ntif0.9 (Wu et al., 2022). These datasets contain graphs\nwith a single type of motif or structural pattern repeated\nthroughout. Multiple Motif includes BA-HouseAndGrid,\nBA-HouseOrGrid (Bui et al., 2024), and BA-HouseOrGrid-\nnRnd. The last one is a synthetic dataset we create for veri-\nfying the variform rationale challenge for existing intrinsic\nmethods (see Appendix E for more details). These datasets\ninvolve graphs with multiple types of motifs, thereby in-\ncreasing the complexity and providing a more challenging\nscenario for explanation methods. Real Dataset include Mu-\ntag (Luo et al., 2020) and Benzene (Sanchez-Lengeling et al.,\n2020). Appendix E.5 visually illustrates sample graphs from\neach dataset and interpretation results of different models.\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nTable 1.

We evaluate the interpretability of several meth-\nods by differentiating between post-hoc and intrinsic in-\nterpretable approaches. The post-hoc methods we com-\npare include GNNExplainer (Ying et al., 2019), PGEx-\nplainer (Luo et al., 2020), MatchExplainer (Wu et al., 2023),\nand Mage (Bui et al., 2024). Additionally, we consider\nthe intrinsic interpretable methods DIR (Wu et al., 2022),\nGSAT (Miao et al., 2022), and GMT-Lin (Chen et al., 2024),\nknown for their state-of-the-art interpretation capabilities\nand generalization performance.\n\nSetup. Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) (Xu et al., 2019)\nis the default backbone GNN used in baseline models. Be-\ncause our framework, TOPING, is fundamentally topologi-\ncal based, we also implement it on the CINPP (Giusti et al.,\n2023) backbone to showcase its full capabilities. This will al-\nlow our method to naturally extend beyond standard graphs\nand operate directly on more general filtrations, including\nthose on richer topological domains like simplicial com-\nplexes (Bodnar et al., 2021a;b) and hypergraphs.\n\nMetrics and evaluation. For interpretation evaluation, we\nreport explanation ROC AUC following (Ying et al., 2019;\nLuo et al., 2020). For prediction performance, we report\nclassification accuracy for real datasets and SPmotif (Wu\net al., 2022) for generalization performance. All the results\nare averaged over 5 runs tested with different random seeds.\nAll methods adopt the same graph encoder and optimization\n\nprotocol to ensure fair comparisons. We employ recom-\nmended hyperparameter settings on baseline methods.\n\n4.2. Result Comparison and Analysis\n\nVariform Rationale Challenge. As shown in Figure 3, the\ninterpretability of two SOTA intrinsic methods decreases\ndrastically when the complexity of rationale subgraphs in-\ncreases. Our method\u2019s performance is much better and more\nstable on such datasets with variform rationales. See Fig-\nure 14 in Section E.5 for more visualization results.\n\nInterpretation performance. As shown in Table 1, com-\npared to the most post-hoc based methods(in the first row),\nand latest intrinsic interpretable models (in the second/third\nrow), TOPING has shown significant improvement across al-\nmost all datasets. Especially on the Spurious-Motif datasets,\nwhich are challenging due to spurious correlations in the\ntraining data, we achieve significant improvement over the\nprevious best approach. On the challenging Multiple Mo-\ntif and Benzene datasets, TOPING even achieves the best\nperformance.\n\nPrediction performance. We compare the results of all\nintrinsic interpretable models training from scratch. Table 2\nshows the prediction accuracy on Real Dataset and Spuri-\nous Motif. TOPING significantly outperforms other baseline\nmodels on the Spurious-Motif datasets, which exhibit vary-\n\n8\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we introduced TOPING, a novel intrinsically\ninterpretable GNN framework that leverages persistent ho-\nmology to identify stable rational subgraphs through persis-\ntent rationale filtration learning. Our approach introduces a\nself-adjusted topological constraint, topological discrepancy,\nto measure the statistical topological difference between\ngraph distributions. We provided theoretical guarantees that\nour target function can be uniquely optimized by ground\ntruth under certain conditions. Through extensive experi-\nments, we demonstrated that TOPING effectively addresses\nkey challenges in interpretable GNNs, including handling\nvariiform rationale subgraphs, balancing performance and\ninterpretability, and avoiding spurious correlations.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe greatly thank the actionable suggestions given by re-\nviewers.

This work\ndirectly addresses this gap by introducing TOPING, a novel\nframework that leverages a topological perspective to build\nmore transparent AI systems. By learning to identify sta-\nble and persistent rationale subgraphs, TOPING enables\nresearchers to clarify the decision-making process of their\nmodels, which is crucial in scientific applications like chem-\nistry and biology where understanding the causal mecha-\nnism is as important as the prediction itself. This ability to\nhandle complex and varied rationales leads to more reliable\ninterpretations and improved generalization, providing a\nnew path toward trustworthy AI.\n\nFigure 3. In BA-HouseOrGrid-nRnd dataset, as nRnd increases,\nthe complexity of rationale subgraphs increases. Existing SOTA\nmethods struggles on such datasets, while TOPING\u2019s performance\nis much better and stable.\n\ning degrees of spurious correlations. This supports our claim\nthat the model can more effectively focus on classifying the\noptimal stable subgraph through persistent rationale filtra-\ntion learning.\n\nTable 3.

In addition to the interpretability and\ngeneralizability analysis, we also conduct further ablation\nstudies to gain a deeper understanding of the results. Table\n3 illustrates the usefulness of topological discrepancy and\nthe prior regularizer. Topological discrepancy is essential\nfor identifying stable and complex substructures, and the\nprior regularizer can be useful in partitioning a graph. We\nalso examine the sensitivity of hyperparameters on the BA-\nHouseAndGrid dataset. As shown in Fig. 4, TOPING main-\ntains stable performance on different settings of weights\nof topological discrepancy and prior regularization. The\nperformance decreases on too large or too small weights.\n\n(a) Sensitivity of Interpretation\n\n(b) Sensitivity of Prediction\n\nFigure 4.

More details of TDA\n\nBottleneck Distance:\n\nDefinition B.1 (Bottleneck Distance). Let P1 and P2 be two persistent barcodes. A partial matching \u03c0 between P1 and\nP2 is a subset of P1 \u00d7 P2 such that each point in P1 and P2 appears in at most one pair in \u03c0. For any p = (p1, p2) \u2208 R2,\ndenote \u00afp = (p2 \u2212 p1, p2 \u2212 p1). Geometrically, \u00afp is the closest point of p to the diagonal line \u2206 = {(x, x) | x \u2208 R}. The\nbottleneck distance between P1 and P2 is defined as:\n\ndB(P1, P2) = inf\n\u03c0\n\nmax{ max\n(p,q)\u2208\u03c0\n\n\u2225p \u2212 q\u2225\u221e, max\n\np\u2208P1\\\u03c01\n\n\u2225p \u2212 \u00afp\u2225\u221e, max\n\nq\u2208P2\\\u03c02\n\n\u2225q \u2212 \u00afq\u2225\u221e}\n\n(3)\n\nwhere:\n\n\u2022 \u03c0 ranges over all partial matchings between P1 and P2\n\n\u2022 \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225\u221e denotes the \u221e-norm\n\n\u2022 \u03c01 and \u03c02 denote the projections of \u03c0 onto P1 and P2 respectively\n\nIntuitively, bottleneck distance measures the minimum cost of transforming one barcode to another by moving each point to\nanother point in the other barcode. The cost is measured by the maximum distance between matched points in a partial\nmatching, or the maximum distance between the rest unmatched points to the diagonal line \u2206. The bottleneck distance\nis a metric on the space of persistent barcodes, which is well studied in topological data analysis (Edelsbrunner & Harer,\n\n15\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\n2010; Zomorodian & Carlsson, 2004; Chazal et al., 2014; Dey & Xin, 2018). It is shown in (Edelsbrunner & Harer, 2010)\nthat the bottleneck distance is a stable metric on the space of persistent barcodes, which means that small perturbations in\nthe input data will not change the bottleneck distance too much. This property is crucial for the stability of the persistent\nhomology, which is a key property for the robustness and differentiability of all vector representations based on persistent\nhomology (Dey & Xin, 2021; 2022; Xin, 2023).\n\nC. Missing Proofs\n\nProof of Theorem 3.4\n\nProof. By the assumption we know that the first term can only be optimized by GX \u2265 G\u2217\nis uniquely maximized by G\u2217\nto the region that satisfies f\u03d5|E\u2217\n\n> 0.5 + \u03b4 (the partition threshold t = 0.5 is fixed).\n\nX . We just need to show that dtopo\nX . In other words, we could assume that we have already restricted f\u03d5\n\nX among those GX \u2265 G\u2217\n\nX\n\nFor a given G and a fixed partition GX \u2294 G\u03f5 determined by some f\u03d5, let p0, p1 be the 0-th and 1-st persistence diagrams,\nand q0, q1 be the 0-th and 1-st persistence diagrams. Observe that the bottleneck distance between the 0-th persistence\ndiagrams dB(p0, q0) is maximized when\n\nf\u03d5(e) = 1{e \u2208 GX }.\n\n(4)\n\nThe reason is that since we only care about edge filtrations, the filtration values on nodes can be viewed as some global\nminimum constant value which is commonly set to be time 0 (or more precisely, 1 for GX and 0.5 for G\u03f5 since we build\nthe filtration in the reversed ordering of importance). Then since |E\u03f5| > |EX | =\u21d2 |q0| > |p0|, we hope to maximize\nthe death times of points in q0 and minimize the death times of points in p0 to maximize dB(p0, q0), which gives us the\nconstant filtration function f\u03d5(e) = 1{e \u2208 GX } on each partition. Then, for constant filtration functions, the induced\ngraph filtrations are essentially reduced to static graphs, and in consequences, persistent homology is essentially reduced to\nhomology. For 0-degree homology, we just need to compare the 0-th Betti numbers \u03b2\u03f5\n0 between G\u03f5 and GX . In that\n0 \u2212 \u03b2X\ncase, dB(p, q) = C(\u03b2\u03f5\n0 ) = C(|E\u03f5| \u2212 |EX |) = C(|GE| \u2212 2|EX |) for some constant C independent of \u03d5 or G. This is\nmaximized when GX = G\u2217\nX .\n\n0 and \u03b2X\n\nThe rest is to check the bottleneck distance dB(p1, q1) on 1-th persistence diagrams. In a similar way one can check that\ndB(p1, q1) should be maximized for some constant filtration function. Then the problem is again reduced to compare\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03f5\nthe 1-degree homology between GX and G\u03f5. That is |\u03b2X\n1| \u2264 \u03b21 for \u03b21 be the\n1-st Betti number of the original graph. By the property of the Euler characteristic on a connected graph we know that\n\u03b21 \u2264 |E| \u2212 |V | + 1 \u2264 |E| \u2264 |V |2. Therefore, dB(p1, q1) \u2264 M for some large enough M over the whole dataset.\n\n1|. However, observe that |\u03b2X\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b2\u03f5\n\nBased on that, since dtopo is essentially a weighted sum of dB on both 0-th and 1-st persistence diagrams, we just need a\nlarge enough constant scaling factor on 0-th persistence diagrams. Then it can been guaranteed that our dtopo is optimized by\nG\u2217\nX }. Such constant factor can be easily learned by our neural networks, or fixed by hand in the\nmodel.\n\n\u03d5(e) = 1{e \u2208 G\u2217\n\nX with f \u2217\n\nD. Limitation\n\nOne limitation of our model is the computational cost. Currently the bottleneck is limited by the computation of the\ntopological invariants. In theory, the time complexity of the persistent homology computation is O(n\u03c9), where n is\nthe number of simplices (nodes for degree 0, edges for degree 1, and faces for degree 2) and \u03c9 \u2264 2.371552 is the\nmatrix multiplication exponent (Williams et al., 2024). Although on graphs, the 0-th and 1-st persistent homology can\nbe computed much faster in O(n log n) time, the main bottleneck is not in theoretical computational complexity, but in\npractical implementation.\n\nPractical Runtime Analysis. To provide concrete insights into the computational overhead, we measured the actual training\ntime on representative datasets. On BA-2Motifs, each training epoch takes approximately half a minute, while on SPMotif\n(a more complex and larger dataset), the runtime is approximately 10 minutes per epoch. All experiments were conducted\non a single RTX 4090 GPU. Importantly, our method consistently converges within 20 epochs across all datasets, in contrast\nto baseline methods that usually require 50-100 epochs to converge.\n\nWhile our method is relatively slower per epoch due to TDA incorporation, this overhead is justified by significant\nperformance gains and faster convergence. The reduced number of required epochs (20 vs. 50-100 for baselines) partially\n\n16\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\ncompensates for the per-epoch computational cost, making the total training time competitive with baseline methods while\nachieving consistently superior interpretability performance.\n\nImplementation Bottlenecks and Future Directions. The current software package cannot fully utilize the parallel\ncomputation power of GPUs. The data transfer between GPU memory and CPU memory takes much I/O cost. Maybe\nsome system-level optimization based on the CUDA framework can help. Some attempts have been made to use GPU to\naccelerate the computation of persistent homology (Zhang et al., 2020), but the performance is still not satisfactory enough.\nAnother possible solution is to use some approximation algorithms to compute the topological invariants. For example,\nsome efficient sparsification methods (Dey et al., 2019), or pretained NNs for computing persistent homology (Yan et al.,\n2022). We leave these problems for the future.\n\nE. More Details about the Experiments\n\nE.1. Datasets\n\nMutag (Kazius et al., 2005): The dataset involves a task of predicting molecular properties, specifically determining whether\na molecule is mutagenic. The functional groups -NO2 and -NH2 are regarded as definitive indicators that contribute to\nmutagenicity, as noted by (Luo et al., 2020).\n\nBenzene (Sanchez-Lengeling et al., 2020): The dataset comprises 12,000 molecular graphs sourced from ZINC15 (Sterling\n& Irwin, 2015). The objective is to identify the presence of benzene rings within a molecule. The carbon atoms in these\nbenzene rings serve as the ground-truth explanations.\n\nBA-2Motifs (Luo et al., 2020): The dataset involves a binary classification task in which each graph combines a Barabasi-\nAlbert base structure with either a house motif or a five-cycle motif. The graph\u2019s label and ground-truth explanation are\nbased on the motif it includes.\n\nSPmotif (Wu et al., 2022): The dataset consists of graphs that merge a base structure with a motif. Each graph is manually\ninfused with a spurious correlation between the base and the motif. The graph\u2019s label and the ground truth explanation are\ndetermined by the motif it contains. Specifically, each graph comprises a base graph \u00afGS (tree, ladder, or wheel, encoded as\n0, 1, 2) and a motif GS (cycle, house, or crane, also encoded as 0, 1, 2). The label is solely determined by GS, but a spurious\ncorrelation is introduced between the label and \u00afGS. During training, GS is sampled uniformly, while \u00afGS is sampled with:\n\nP ( \u00afGS) =\n\n(cid:40)\n\nb,\n1\u2212b\n2 ,\n\nif \u00afGS = GS\notherwise\n\nHere, b \u2208 [ 1\nFor testing, \u00afGS and GS are randomly paired to assess overfitting to spurious correlations.\n\n3 , 1] controls the degree of spurious correlation; b = 1\n\n3 implies independence. We consider b = 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9.\n\nBA-HouseGrid: The house and grid motifs are chosen because they do not have overlapping structures, such as those found\nin the house and 3 \u00d7 3 grid.\n\nBA-HouseAndGrid (Bui et al., 2024): Each graph is based on a Barabasi-Albert structure and may be linked with either a\nhouse motif or a grid motif. Graphs that contain both types of motifs are labeled as 1, while those containing only one type\nare labeled as 0. Note that each motif appears at most once in each graph.\n\nBA-HouseOrGrid (Bui et al., 2024): Similar to BA-HouseAndGrid, graphs that contain either house motif or grid motif are\nlabeled as 1, while those containing neither type are labeled as 0. Note that each motif appears at most once in each graph.\n\nBA-HouseOrGrid-nRnd: Similar to BA-HouseOrGrid, graphs that contain either n house motifs or n grid motifs are\nlabeled as 1, where n is a random integer between 1 (inclusive) and n (inclusive). More formally:\n\n\u2022 Label Assignment:\n\nP (Label = 1) = 0.5, P (Label = 0) = 0.5\n\n\u2022 For Label = 1: Given n \u2208 Z+, for each i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}, the three possible manifestations are:\n\nP (i \u00d7 grid + i \u00d7 house) =\n\n1\n6n\n\n,\n\n17\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nP (i \u00d7 grid) =\n\nP (i \u00d7 house) =\n\n1\n6n\n\n,\n\n1\n6n\n\n.\n\nWhen grid and house appear simultaneously, their counts are equal. We do not consider cases where houses and\ngrids appear simultaneously in different quantities. To ensure a balanced dataset and to avoid potential bias in model\ntraining and evaluation, we first guarantee that the number of graphs with label 0 and label 1 is equal. Furthermore,\nwithin label 1, we generate an equal number of graphs for the above three manifestations. Therefore, the entire dataset\nmaintains a balanced distribution across subcategories.\n\nE.2. Details on Hyperparamter Tuning\n\nE.2.1. BACKBONE MODELS\n\nBackbone Architecture. We use a two-layer GIN (Xu et al., 2019) with 64 hidden dimensions and 0.3 dropout ratio for\nall baselines. We use a three-layer CINpp (Giusti et al., 2023) with 64 hidden dimensions and 0.15/0.3 dropout ratio for\nTOPING. For all datasets, we directly follow (Giusti et al., 2023) using enhanced Topological Message Passing scheme\nincluding messages that flow within the lower neighbourhood, the upper neighbourhood and boundary neighbourhood of\nthe underlying cell complex. Considering that the largest chordless cycle for most interpretable motifs is equal to 5 (the\nBA-2Motifs dataset includes a 5-cycle, while most of the other motifs have chordless cycles with a maximum length of 4),\nwe lift the maximum length of a chordless cycle to 5 as the cell(dim=2).\n\nData Splits. For BA synthetic datasets, we follow the previous work (Miao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2024; Bui et al., 2024)\nto split them into three sets(80%/10%/10%). For SPmotifs and real datasets, we use the default splits.\n\nEvaluation. We report the performance of the epoch with the highest validation prediction accuracy and use these models as\nthe pre-trained models. If multiple epochs achieve the same top performance, we choose the one with the lowest validation\nprediction loss.\n\nE.3. More Comparison Results\n\nTo further evaluate the effectiveness of TOPING modules and compare with the previous intrinsic interpretable baselines, we\nadditionally conduct experiments from the perspectives of constraints and regularization on both GIN and CINpp backbones.\nThe results are given in the table 5. Details are as follows.\n\nConstraint. Central to existing self-interpretability is the incorporation of the information bottleneck principle into the\nGNN architecture. We follow previous works to re-implement this infomation constraint under the author-recommended\nhyperparameters for a fair comparison. The \u03bb of information regularizer is set to be 1. As for topological constraint, we set\nthe coefficient to 0.01 to achieve the best performance, which aligning with Figure 4.\n\nRegularization. For marginal prior regularization, the choice of information constraint is a KL divergence regularizer.\nSpecifically, for every graph G \u223c PG and every undirected edge e in G, we sample \u03b1e \u223c Bern(r) where r \u2208 [0, 1] is a\nhyperparameter. The formulation of the mutual information regularizer is:\n\nDKL (Bern(\u03b1e) \u2225 Bern(r)) =\n\n(cid:88)\n\n(cid:20)\n\u03b1e log\n\ne\n\n\u03b1e\nr\n\n+ (1 \u2212 \u03b1e) log\n\n(cid:21)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b1e\n1 \u2212 r\n\n(5)\n\nr is initially set to 0.9 and gradually decay to the tuned value 0.7. We adopt a step decay,where r will decay 0.1 for every 10\nepochs. As it is mentioned in TOPING, we employ a mixture of two Gaussian distributions to establish a prior regularization\nterm on GX and G\u03f5, as outlined in Section 3.2. It is noteworthy that our choice aligns with the use of a standard Gaussian\ndistribution as the latent distribution in variational auto-encoders. For fair comparison, we set the coefficient of Gaussian\nregularizer to 1.\n\nDifferent components have different effects. Once could select the best combination and train the new architecture to better\nextract the subgraph information. Moreover, We provide more discussions and analysis about the the results in the table 5.\nSpecifically,\n\n18\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nTable 5.

However, the performance of\ngraph information bottleneck framework remains highly degenerated in simple task BA-2Motifs and complicated\ntask BA-HouseOrGrid-2Rnd. Due to the formulation 5, there exists a trivial solution where all values of \u03b1e converge\ndirectly to the given value of r. CINpp employs distinct perceptrons for each layer of the network and each dimension\nof the complex. It iteratively performs message passing for different types of adjacency. This unique architecture can\nlead information constraint more easily to zero loss, i.e., \u03b1e = r. It will result in the inability to distinguish between\ninterpretable subgraphs and noise subgraphs.\n\n\u2022 The topological constraint with a Gaussian prior distribution significantly outperforms both GIN and CINpp across all\ntasks, although it occasionally slightly reduces accuracy. Equipped with a more powerful expressive model, TOPING\ncan easily learn persistent rationale filtration through topological discrepancy loss. One surprising result is that\nusing only the Gaussian distribution yields highly competitive results in interpreting spurious motif datasets and the\nBA-HouseOrGrid-nRnd datasets. Nevertheless, the interpretation performance on Benzene dataset remains highly\ndegenerated.\n\nE.4. Regarding the result of MUTAG\n\nThe results of MUTAG can be attributed to the uniquely simple structure of MUTAG\u2019s rationale subgraphs. MUTAG\u2019s\nrationale subgraphs consist of just two edges sharing a common node (the functional groups -NO2 and -NH2). This\nrepresents the simplest possible non-trivial subgraph structure, lacking the topological complexity present in other datasets.\nSpecifically:\n\n\u2022 There are no cycles (1-homology features)\n\n\u2022 The 0-homology structure (connectivity) is nearly trivial\n\n\u2022 The rationale can be identified primarily through node/edge features rather than topological structure\n\nIn such cases, our topological discrepancy measure, which excels at capturing complex structural patterns, may introduce\nunnecessary complexity by analyzing features (like cycle bases) that aren\u2019t relevant to the true rationale. The model ends up\nrelying more heavily on the prediction loss other than the interpretability regularization.\n\nFollowing up on our previous response regarding MUTAG performance, we conducted additional experiments that provide\ncompelling evidence for our analysis. Our investigation revealed that the initial lower performance on MUTAG stemmed\nfrom incorporating both 0th and 1st dimensional persistent homology features. However, the rationale subgraphs of MUTAG\n\u2014- primarily NO2 and NH2 functional groups \u2014- have relatively simple structures. Therefore, tracking higher-dimensional\ntopological features like cycles introduced unnecessary complexity that hurt the model\u2019s performance.\n\nAs shown in the Table 6, TopInG-0 achieves the second-best performance in both interpretability (AUC) and prediction\n(ACC) compared to baseline interpretable GNN models. These results validate our analysis and demonstrate that our\napproach remains highly competitive when properly configured for molecular datasets with simpler structural patterns.\n\n19\n\n\fTopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning via Persistent Rationale Filtration\n\nTable 6.

Our\napproach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,\nour approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%\non GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and\nGSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical\nanalyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we\ndemonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and\nefficient systems through the proposed approach.",

Our dataset, agent,\nand code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1\nAcademic presentation videos are widely used in research communication, serving as a crucial and\neffective means to bridge researchers, as many conferences require them as an essential material for\nsubmission. However, the manual creation of such a video is highly labor-intensive, requiring slide\ndesign, subtitle writing, per-slide recording, and careful editing, which on average may take several\nhours to produce a 2 to 10 minute video for a scientific paper. Despite some prior works on slide and\nposter generation [29, 38, 22] and other AI4Research tasks [4, 3, 12, 25, 20], automatic academic\npresentation video generation is a superproblem of them, a practical yet more challenging direction.\nUnlike natural video generation [2, 37, 31, 10], presentation video exhibits distinctive characteristics,\nincluding multi-sensory integration, multi-figure conditioning, and high text density, which highlight\nthe limitations of current natural video generation models [19]. Specifically, academic presentation\nvideo generation faces several crucial challenges: a. It originates from long-context papers that\ncontain dense text as well as multiple figures and tables; b. It requires the coordination of multiple\naligned channels, including slide generation [38], subtitling, text-to-speech [6], cursor control, and\ntalking head generation [32, 8]; c. It lacks well-defined evaluation metrics: what constitutes a good\npresentation video, particularly in terms of knowledge conveyance and audience accessibility. Even\nfor the state-of-the-art end-to-end video\u2013audio generation model Veo3 [10], notable limitations\nremain in video length, clarity of dense on-screen text, and multi-modal long-document condition. In\nthis work, we try to solve these two core problems as shown in Figure 1.\nTo enable comprehensive evaluation of academic presentation video generation, we present the\nPaper2Video Benchmark, comprising 101 paired research papers and author-recorded presentation\nvideos from recent conferences, together with original slides and speaker identity metadata. Based\non this benchmark, we develop a suite of metrics to comprehensively evaluate generation quality\nfrom multiple dimensions: (i) Meta Similarity \u2014 We employ a VLM to evaluate the alignment of\n\n\u2217 Equal contribution.\n(cid:66) Corresponding author.\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fpreprint\n\nFigure 1: This work solves two core problems for academic presentations: Left: how to create a\npresentation video from a paper? PaperTalker \u2013 an agent integrates slide, subtitling, cursor grounding,\nspeech synthesis, and talking-head video rendering. Right: how to evaluate a presentation video?\nPaper2Video \u2013 a benchmark with well-designed metrics to evaluate presentation quality.\ngenerated slides and subtitles with human-designed counterparts. (ii) PresentArena \u2014 We use a\nVideoLLM as a proxy audience to perform double-order pairwise comparisons between generated\nand human-made videos. Notably, the primary purpose of a presentation is to effectively convey the\ninformation contained in the paper. To this end, we introduce (iii) PresentQuiz, which treats the\nVideoLLMs as the audience and requires them to answer paper-derived questions given the videos.\nFurthermore, another important purpose of presentation video is to enhance the visibility and impact\nof the author\u2019s work. Motivated by real-conference interactions, we introduce (iv) IP Memory, which\nmeasures how well an audience can associate authors and works after watching presentation videos.\nTo effectively generate ready-to-use academic presentation videos, we propose PaperTalker, the\nfirst multi-agent framework that enables academic presentation video generation from research\npapers and speaker identity. It integrates subsequent key modules: (i) Slide Generation. Instead\nof adopting the commonly used format (e.g., pptx, XML) from a template slide as in [38], we\nemploy LaTeX code for slide generation from sketch, given its formal suitability for academic use and\nhigher efficiency. Specifically, we employ a state-of-the-art Coder to generate code and introduce an\neffective focused debugging strategy, which iteratively narrows the scope and resolves compilation\nerrors using feedback that indicates the relevant rows. To address the insensitivity of LLMs to\nfine-grained numerical adjustments, we propose a novel method called Tree Search Visual Choice.\nThis approach systematically explores parameter variations to generate multiple branches, which\nare then concatenated into a single figure. A VLM is then tasked with selecting the optimal branch,\nthereby effectively improving element layouts such as figure and font size. (ii) Subtitling and Cursor\nGrounding. We generate subtitles and cursor prompts for each sentence based on the slides. Then we\nachieve cursor spatial-temporal alignment using Computer-use grounding model [17, 23] models\nand WhisperX [1] respectively. (iii) Speech Synthesis and Talking-head Rendering. We synthesize\npersonalized speech via text-to-speech models [5] and produce talking-head videos [8, 32] for author\npresentations. Inspired by human recording practice and the independence between each slide, we\nparallelize generation across slides, achieving a speedup of more than 6\u00d7. We will open-source all\nour data and codebase to empower the research community.\nTo summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We present Paper2Video, the first high-quality benchmark of 101 papers with author-recorded\npresentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata, together with evaluation metrics: Meta Similarity,\nPresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory.\n\n\u2022 We propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation.\nIt introduces three key modules: (i) tree search visual choice for fine-grained slide generation; (ii) a\nGUI-grounding model coupled with WhisperX for spatial-temporal aligned cursor grounding; and\n(iii) slide-wise parallel generation to improve efficiency.\n\n\u2022 Results on Paper2Video confirm the effectiveness of PaperTalker, which outperforms human-made\npresentations by 10% in PresentQuiz accuracy and achieves comparable ratings in user studies,\nindicating that its quality approaches that of human-created content.\n\n2 RELATED WORKS\n2.1 VIDEO GENERATION\nRecent advances in video diffusion models [2, 31, 14, 15] have substantially improved natural video\ngeneration in terms of length, quality, and controllability. However, these end-to-end diffusion\nmodels still struggle to produce long videos [10, 32] (e.g., several minutes), handle multiple shots,\nand support conditioning on multiple images [19]. Moreover, most existing approaches generate only\nvideo without aligned audio, leaving a gap for real-world applications. To address these limitations,\nrecent works leverage multi-agent collaboration to generate multi-shot, long video\u2013audio pairs\n\n2\n\nPaperVoicePortraitHow to createa presentation video?Presentation Video(by Ours)Presentation Video(by Human)How to evaluatean presentation video?InputsPaperTalkerPaper2Video\u2705Slide \u2705Subtitle\u2705Speech\u2705Talker\u2705Cursor\fpreprint\n\nTable 1: Comparison of Paper2Video with existing benchmarks.

Specifically, for natural videos, MovieAgent [35] adopts a\nhierarchical CoT planning strategy and leverages LLMs to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter,\nstoryboard artist, and location manager, thereby enabling long-form movie generation. Alternatively,\nPresentAgent [26] targets presentation video generation but merely combines PPTAgent [38] with\ntext-to-speech to produce narrated slides. However, it lacks personalization (e.g., mechanical speech\nand absence of a presenter) and fails to generate academic-style slides (e.g., missing opening and\noutline slides), thereby limiting its applicability in academic contexts. Our work addresses these\nlimitations and enables ready-to-use academic presentation video generation.\n\n2.2 AI FOR RESEARCH\n\nMany useful tasks have been explored under the umbrella of AI for Research (AI4Research) [4],\nwhich aims to support the full scholarly workflow spanning text [9], static visuals [22], and dynamic\nvideo [26]. With the breakthrough of LLMs in text generation and the Internet search ability,\nextensive efforts have been devoted to academic writing [3] and literature surveying [16, 11, 18, 12],\nsubstantially improving research efficiency. Besides, some works [28, 36] benchmark AI agents\u2019\nend-to-end ability to replicate top-performing ML papers, while others leverage agents to enable idea\nproposal [27] and data-driven scientific inspiration [7, 21]. To further enhance productivity, a growing\nnumber of work focuses on the automatic visual design of figures [33], slides [38], posters [22],\nand charts [13]. More recently, Paper2Agent [20] has reimagined research papers as interactive\nand reliable AI agents, designed to assist readers in understanding scientific works. However, very\nfew studies have investigated video generation for scientific purposes, leaving this area relatively\nunderexplored. Our work belongs to one of the pioneering efforts in this direction, initiating a\nsystematic study on academic presentation video generation.\n\n3 PAPER2VIDEO BENCHMARK\n\n3.1 TASK DEFINITION\n\nGiven a research paper and the author\u2019s identity information, our goal is to automatically synthesize\nan academic presentation video that faithfully conveys the paper\u2019s core contributions in an audience-\nfriendly manner. We identify that a perfect presentation video is usually required to integrate four\ncoordinated components: (i) slides contain well-organized, visually oriented, expressive figures and\ntables with concise text description; (ii) synchronized subtitles and speech are semantically aligned\nwith the slides, including supplementary details; (iii) presenter should exhibit natural yet professional\nfacial expressions, ideally accompanied by appropriate gestures; and (iv) a cursor indicator serves\nas an attentional anchor, helping the audience focus and follow the narration.\nThis task poses several distinctive challenges: a. Multi-modal Long-Context Understanding.\nResearch papers span many pages with dense text, equations, figures, and tables. b. Multi-turn\nAgent Tasks. It is challenging to solve this task with a single end-to-end model, as it requires multi-\nchannel generation and alignment (e.g., slides, cursors, and presenter). c. Personalized Presenter\nSynthesis. Achieving high-quality, identity-preserving, and lip-synchronous talking-head video\nremains time-consuming, and even more challenging when jointly modeling voice, face, and gesture.\nd. Spatial-Temporal-Grounding. Producing cursor trajectories synchronized with narration and\nslide content demands precise alignment between linguistic units and visual anchors.\n\n3\n\n\fpreprint\n\n(a) Word cloud of topics\n\n(b) Slides per video\n\n(c) Video length\n\nFigure 2: Statistics of Paper2Video benchmark.\nIt spans diverse topics, with presentations\ncomprising 4\u201328 slides and lasting 2\u201314 min, providing a valuable benchmark for the automatic\ngeneration and evaluation of academic presentation videos.\n\n3.2 DATA CURATION\n\nData Source. We use AI conference papers as the data source for two reasons: (i) they offer\nhigh-quality, diverse content across subfields with rich text, figures, and tables; and (ii) the field\u2019s\nrapid growth and open-sharing culture provide plentiful, polished author-recorded presentations\nand slides on YouTube and SlidesLive. However, complete metadata are often unavailable (e.g.,\npresentation videos, slides, presenter images, and voice samples). We thus manually select papers\nwith relatively complete metadata and supplement missing fields by sourcing presenter images from\nauthors\u2019 websites. Overall, we curate 101 peer-reviewed conference papers from the past three years:\n41 from machine learning (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML), 40 from computer vision (e.g., CVPR,\nICCV, ECCV), and 20 from natural language processing(e.g., ACL, EMNLP, NAACL). Each instance\nincludes the paper\u2019s full LATEX project and a matched, author-recorded presentation video comprising\nthe slide and talking-head streams with speaker identity (e.g., portrait and voice sample). For 40%\nof the data, we additionally collect the original slide files (PDF), enabling direct, reference-based\nevaluation of slide generation.\nData Statistics. Overall, Paper2Video covers 101 paper-video pairs spanning diverse topics as\nshown in Figure 2 (a), ensuring broad coverage across fields. The paper contains 13.3K words(3.3K\ntokens), 44.7 figures, and 28.7 pages on average, serving as multi-modal long document inputs. As\nillustrated in Figure 2 (b) and (c), we also report the distributions of slides per presentation and video\ndurations in Paper2Video. On average, presentations contain 16 slides and last 6min 15s, with some\nsamples reaching up to 14 minutes. Although Paper2Video comprises 101 curated presentations, the\nbenchmark is designed to evaluate long-horizon agentic tasks rather than mere video generation.\n\n3.3 EVALUATION METRICS\n\nUnlike natural video generation, academic presentation videos serve a highly specialized role: they\nare not merely about visual fidelity but about communicating scholarship. This makes it difficult to\ndirectly apply conventional metrics from video synthesis (e.g., FVD, IS, or CLIP-based similarity).\nInstead, their value lies in how well they disseminate research, amplify scholarly visibility.\nFrom this perspective, we argue that a high-quality academic presentation video should be judged\nalong two complementary dimensions (see Figure 3): For the audience: the video is expected to\nfaithfully convey the paper\u2019s core ideas(i.e., motivation and contributions), while remaining accessible\nto audiences. For the author: the video should foreground the authors\u2019 intellectual contribution\nand identity, and enhance the work\u2019s visibility and impact. To systematically capture these goals, we\nintroduce tailored evaluation metrics specifically designed for academic presentation videos.\nMeta Similarity \u2013 How video like human-made? As we have the ground-truth human-made presenta-\ntion videos with original slides, we evaluate how well the generated intermediate assets (i.e., speech,\nslides, and subtitles) aligned with the ones created by authors, which serves as the pseudo ground-\ntruth. (i) For each slide, we pair the slide image with its corresponding subtitles and submit both the\ngenerated pair and the human-made pair to the VLMs to obtain a similarity score on a five-point scale.\n(ii) To further assess speech(i.e., vocal timbre), we uniformly sample a ten-second segment from\nthe presentation audio, encode the generated and human-recorded audio with a speaking embedding\nmodel [24], and compute the cosine similarity between the embeddings to measure speech similarity.\n\n4\n\n481216202428024681012CountsAverage 16.0Median 14.0Slides per Video DistributionSlides per videoSample Number246810120102030405060CountsAverage 6:15Median 5:11Video Length DistributionMinutesSample Number\fpreprint\n\nFigure 3: Overview of evaluation metrics. We propose three metrics that systematically evaluate\nacademic presentation video generation from the perspective of the relationship between the generated\nvideo and (i) the original paper and (ii) the human-made video.\nPresentArena \u2013 Which video is better? Similar to the human audience watching the presentation,\nwe employ the VideoLLMs as the proxy audience to conduct pairwise comparisons of presentation\nvideos, where the winning rate serves as the metric. For each pair, the model is queried twice in\nopposite orders: (A, B) and (B, A). This procedure reduces hallucinations and position bias. The\ntwo judgments are then aggregated by averaging to obtain a more stable preference estimation.\nPresentQuiz \u2013 How videos conveys the paper knowledge? Following prior work [22], we evaluate\ninformation coverage using a multiple-choice quiz on the presentation video. We first generate a set\nof questions with four options and the corresponding correct answers from the source paper. Then we\nask the VideoLLMs to watch the presentation and answer each question. Overall accuracy serves as\nthe metric, with higher accuracy indicating better information coverage.\nIP Memory \u2013 How videos affect the author\u2019s visibility and work impact? Another key purpose of\nacademic presentation videos is to enhance the visibility and impact of the author\u2019s work. Yet, this\nmetric is unclear and difficult to simulate and thus remains an open problem. In real-conference\nsettings, audiences who recall a scholar after attending their presentation are more inclined to pose\nrelevant questions in later interactions. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a metric to\nassess how effectively a presentation video enables the audience to recall the work. Additional\nimplementation details are provided in Appendix B.1.\nFurthermore, to ablate the contribution of each component, we evaluate both the quality and the gains\nprovided by individual components (e.g., slides, cursor, and presenter). Notably, to further assess\npresentation videos from the user perspective, we conduct human studies to evaluate the results.\n\n4 PAPERTALKER AGENT\nOverview. To address these challenges and liberate researchers from the burdensome task of manual\nvideo preparation, we introduce PaperTalker, a multi-agent framework designed to automatically\ngenerate presentation videos directly from academic papers. As illustrated in Figure 4, to decouple the\ndifferent roles, making the method scalable and flexible, the pipeline comprises four builders: (i) Slide\nbuilder. Given the paper, we first synthesize slides with LATEX code and refine them with compilation\nfeedback to correct grammar and optimize layout; (ii) Subtitle builder. The slides are then processed\nby a VLM to generate subtitles and sentence-level visual-focus prompts; (iii) Cursor builder. These\nprompts are then grounded into on-screen cursor coordinates and synchronized with the narration. (iv)\nTalker builder. Given the voice sample and the portrait of the speaker, text-to-speech and talking-head\nmodules generate a realistic, personalized talker video. For clarity, we denote the paper document,\nauthor portrait, and voice sample as D, I, and A, respectively.\n\n4.1 SLIDE BUILDER\n\nA prerequisite for producing a presentation video is the creation of the slides. Despite there being\nsome existing works [38], we target the generation of academic slides with fine-grained layouts and\nformal structure from scratch. Rather than selecting a template and iteratively editing it with VLMs,\nwe generate slides directly from a paper\u2019s LATEX project by prompting the model to write Beamer\ncode. We adopt Beamer for three reasons: (i) LATEX\u2019s declarative typesetting automatically arranges\ntext block and figures from their parameters without explicitly planing the positions; (ii) Beamer is\ncompact and expressive, representing the same content in fewer lines than XML-based formats; and\n\n5\n\nQ1.

Our pipeline comprises three key modules: (i) tree search visual\nchoice for fine-grained slide layout optimization; (ii) a GUI-grounded model paired with WhisperX\nfor spatiotemporally aligned cursor grounding; and (iii) slide-wise parallel generation for efficiency.\n\n(iii) Beamer provides well-designed, formally configured styles (e.g., page numbers, section headers,\nhyperlinks) that are well suited to academic slide design.\n\nGiven the paper D as input, the LLM first produces a draft slide code. We compile this code to collect\ndiagnostics(i.e., errors and warnings). Then, we use the error information to elicit a repaired correct\ncode. This procedure ensures that the generated Beamer code is grammatically correct and effectively\nleverages and faithfully covers its content.\n\nAlthough LATEX can automatically arrange the location of the contents in the slides, the gener-\nated slides could sometimes still suffer from inappropriate layouts (e.g., overflow) due to the\nunsuitable parameters for figure or text font size. However, as the compilation warning signals\npotential layout issues, we are able to first use them to identify the slides that require refinement.\n\nTree Search Visual Choice. After localizing the slides\nthat require refinement, the key challenge is how to adjust\ntheir layouts effectively. As LLMs/VLMs fail to perceive\nreal-time visual feedback like human designers, we ob-\nserve that prompting the them to directly tune numeric\nlayout parameters (e.g., font sizes, margins, figure scales)\nis ineffective: the models are largely insensitive to small\nnumeric changes, yielding unstable and inefficient refine-\nment, consistent with limitations of the parameter-editing\nstrategy in PPTAgent [38]. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce a visual-selection module for overflowed slides.\nThe module first constructs the neighborhoods of layout\nvariants for the current slide by rule-based adjusting the fig-\nure and text parameters, renders each variant to an image,\nand then uses the VLMs as a judge to score the candidates\nand select the one with the best layout. Specifically, for\ntext-only slides, we sweep the font size; for slides with\nfigures, we first vary the figure scaling factors (e.g., 1.25, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25) and then reduce the font\nsize, details shown in Figure 5. These edits are straightforward in LATEX Beamer, whose structured\nsyntax automatically reflows content as parameter changes. This module decouples discrete layout\nsearch from semantic reasoning and reliably resolves overflow cases with minimal time and tokens.\n\nFigure 5: Tree Search Visual Choice.\nIt combines a rule-based proposal mech-\nanism with VLM-based scoring to select\nthe optimal candidate.\n\n6\n\nPaperCoderComplieError: slides.tex:65: Undefined control sequenceWarning: slides.tex:27:Overfull \\hbox (43.83pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 27--27Debugging1.

The visual-focus prompt serves as an intermediate representation linking speech to the\ncursor, enabling precise temporal and spatial alignment of the cursor with the narration in order to\nimprove audience guidance, which will be discussed in Section 4.4.\n4.3 TALKER BUILDER\nThe presenter video is vital for audience engagement and conveying the researcher\u2019s scholarly identity\n(e.g., face and voice). Given the subtitles Ti, the author\u2019s portrait I, and a short voice sample A, our\nobjective is to synthesize a presenter video that delivers the slide content in the author\u2019s voice, with\nfaithful identity preservation and lip\u2013audio synchronization.\nSubtitle-to-Speech. Given subtitles and voice sample, we use F5-TTS [6] to generate speech audio\nper slide, (cid:101)Ai = TTS(cid:0){ T j\nParallel Talkinghead Generation. To balance fidelity and efficiency, we use Hallo2 [8] for head-only\nsynthesis and employ FantasyTalking [32] to support talking generation with upper-body articulation.\nA persistent challenge is the long generation time: generating only a few minutes of talking-head\nvideo typically takes several hours, and some models(e.g., FantasyTalking) do not yet natively\nsupport long-video generation. Inspired by the common practice of slide-by-slide recording and the\nindependence between each slide, we synthesize the presenter video on a per-slide basis. Specifically,\nfor each slide Si, given the audio condition (cid:101)Ai and portrait I, we generate an independent clip Vi and\nexecute these jobs in parallel, markedly reducing generation time: Vi = G\n, i = 1, . . . , n, where\nG represents the talking-head generation model. This design is justified because slide transitions are\nhard scene changes, and the temporal continuity of the presenter across adjacent slides is unnecessary.\n4.4 CURSOR BUILDER\nSpatial-Temporal Grounding. In practice, presenters leverage the cursor as an attentional guide:\na well-aligned cursor trajectory minimizes extraneous cognitive load, helps the audience track the\npresentation, and keeps focus on the key content. However, automatic cursor-trajectory grounding is\nnontrivial, requiring simultaneous alignment to the timing of speech and the visual semantics of the\nslides. To simplify the task, we assume that the cursor will stay still within a sentence and only move\nbetween the sentences. Thus, we estimate a per-sentence cursor location and time span. For spatial\nalignment, motivated by strong computer-use models [17, 23] which simulate user interaction with\nthe screenshot, we propose to ground the cursor location (x, y) for each sentence with the visual focus\nprompt P j\ni by UI-TARS [23]. To achieve precise temporal alignment, we then use WhisperX [1]\nto extract word-level timestamps and align them with the corresponding sentence in the subtitles to\nderive the start and end times (ts, te) of each cursor segment.\n5 EXPERIMENTS\n5.1 BASELINE AND SETTINGS\nWe evaluate three categories of baselines: (i) End-to-end Methods [31, 10], where natural video\ngeneration models produce the presentation video directly from a prompt generated by paper; (ii)\nMulti-Agent Frameworks [26, 38], which combine slide generation with text-to-speech generation\nand compose them into a presentation video; and (iii) PaperTalker, our method and its variants. For\nthe VLM and VideoLLM, we choose GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash, respectively, for a favorable\nefficiency and performance trade-off. We perform inference using eight NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs.\n5.2 MAIN RESULTS\nMeta Similarity. We evaluate the alignment of the generated slides, subtitles, and speech with corre-\nsponding human-authored ones. For speech, we randomly sample a 10-second audio segment from\nthe video generated by each method and compute the cosine similarity between its embeddings [24]\nand those of the author\u2019s speech. As shown in Table 2, PaperTalker attains the highest scores in both\nspeech and content similarity, demonstrating that its outputs align most closely with human creation\namong all baselines. We attribute this performance to personalized TTS and our slide-generation\ndesign: (i) adopting Beamer, which provides formal, academically styled templates while LATEX\nautomatically arranges content within each slide; and (ii) a tree search visual choice layout refinement\nthat further enforces fine-grained slide layouts as commonly observed in human-authored slides.\n\n7\n\n\fpreprint\n\nTable 2: Detailed evaluation result of Paper2Video across three baselines.

We compare the presentation videos generated by each method against the human-\nmade videos. As an automatic evaluator, we prompt the VideoLLMs as a judge to determine which\npresentation is better with respect to clarity, delivery, and engagement. As shown in Table 2, Pa-\nperTalker attains the highest pairwise winning rate among all baselines, indicating that our method\nproduces presentation videos with superior overall perceived quality. Notably, PaperTalker outper-\nforms its variants without the talker and cursor by 1.8%, highlighting the gains introduced by these\ncomponents and implying that the VideoLLM favors presentation videos with a talker presenting.\nPresentQuiz. To assess information coverage, we conduct a VideoQA evaluation. Following prior\nwork on posters [22], we construct QA sets by prompting an LLM to generate questions targeting\n(i) fine-grained details and (ii) higher-level understanding of the paper. The videos and QA sets are\nthen fed into a VideoLLM to conduct the quiz. As shown in Table 2, PaperTalker achieves superior\nperformance across both aspects, outperforming HumanMade and PresentAgent despite shorter video\nlength. This indicates that PaperTalker produces videos that are more informative within shorter\ndurations. Furthermore, the absence of the talker or cursor results in performance degradation, as\nthe cursor trajectory potentially guides the attention and supports accurate grounding of the key\ncontents for the VideoLLMs during inference, referring to Table 4 for more details.\nIP Memory. We evaluate the degree to which the generated presentation videos facilitate audience\nretention of the work, thereby assessing their memorability and lasting impact. PaperTalker achieves\nthe highest recall accuracy. This improvement mainly stems from the inclusion of an engaging talker\nwith the author\u2019s figure and voice, which significantly helps the audience retain the video content.\nHuman Evaluation. To further assess the quality of the gen-\nerated presentations from the user perspective, we conducted a\nhuman evaluation in which ten participants were provided with\neach paper along with its corresponding presentation videos\ngenerated by different methods. Participants were asked to rank\nthe videos according to their preferences(1(worse) \u2212 5(best)).\nAs shown in Figure 6, human-made videos achieve the highest\nscore, with PaperTalker ranking second and outperforming all\nother baselines. This demonstrates that presentation videos gen-\nerated by PaperTalker gain consistently favor from human\nusers over other baselines and comparable to human-made.\n5.3 QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS\nAs shown in Figure 7, PaperTalker produces presentation videos\nthat most closely align with the human-made ones. While\nVeo3 [10] renders a high-quality speaker in front of the screen,\nit is constrained by short duration (e.g., 8s) and blurred text. Besides, PresentAgent[26] typically\nsuffers from the absence of the presenter and slide-design errors (e.g., overflow, incorrect title,\nincomplete author lists, and institutions).\n5.4 KEY ABLATIONS\nWhat benefits are brought by Cursor Highlight? Mo-\ntivated by the observation that a cursor typically helps\naudiences locate the relevant region, we hypothesize that\na visible cursor, by providing an explicit spatial cue, facilitates content grounding for VLMs. To\nevaluate this, we design a localization QA task: for each subtitle sentence and its corresponding slide,\n\nFigure 6: Human evaluation.

PaperTalker produces presentation videos with rich,\nfine-grained slide content, accurate cursor grounding, and an engaging talker; in contrast, Veo3 [10]\nyields blurred text and incomplete information coverage, while PresentAgent [26] produces text-heavy\nslides and suffers from overfull layout issues and inaccurate information (e.g., title and institutions).\na VLM generates a four-option multiple-choice question about the sentence\u2019s corresponding position\non the slide. The VLMs are then prompted to answer using slide screenshots, with or without the\ncursor, and accuracy is measured as the metric. As shown in Table 4, the accuracy is much higher with\nthe cursor highlight, corroborating its importance for the audience\u2019s visual grounding accessibility\nof presentation videos.\n\nTable 5: Evaluation result on slide quality.\n\n4.43\n\n2.85\n\n2.73\n\nMethod\n\n1.29\n3.11\n\n1.57\n2.53\n\n3.43\n4.00\n\nHumanMade\n\nContent (\u2191) Design (\u2191) Coherence (\u2191)\n\nPPTAgentQwen7B [38]\nPaperTalkerQwen7B\nPPTAgentGPT4.1 [38]\nPaperTalkerGPT4.1(w/o Tree Search)\nPaperTalkerGPT4.1\n\nHow does tree search visual choice\nimprove slide quality? To assess the\ncontribution of the tree-search visual\nchoice module, we conduct an abla-\ntion experiment, as shown in Table 5.\nIn line with prior work on slide gen-\neration [38], we assess the generated\nslides using a VLM on a 1\u20135 scale\nacross content, design, and coherence. The results show a pronounced decline in design quality\nwhen layout refinement is removed, highlighting the tree-search visual choice module as a key\ncomponent for slide creation (i.e., resolving overfull issues), referring to Figures 8 for visualization.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nThis work tackles the long-standing bottleneck of presentation video generation by agent automation.\nWith Paper2Video, we provide the first comprehensive benchmark and well-designed metrics to\nrigorously evaluate presentation videos in terms of quality, knowledge coverage, and academic\nmemorability. Our proposed PaperTalker framework demonstrates that automated generation of\nready-to-use academic presentation videos is both feasible and effective, producing outputs that\nclosely approximate author-recorded presentations while significantly reducing production time by 6\ntimes. We hope our work advances AI for Research and supports scalable scholarly communication.\n\n4.07\n4.33\n4.34\n\n2.02\n2.73\n2.85\n\n2.06\n3.84\n3.84\n\n9\n\nVeo3Human-made PresentAgentPaperTalker (Ours)\u2705Speech \u2705Slide \u2705Talker \u274cCursor\u2705Speech \u274cSlide \u2705Talker \u274cCursor \u2705 Speech \u2705 Slide \u274c Talker  \u274c Cursor\u2705Speech \u2705Slide \u2705Talker \u2705Cursorheavy textblurred textoverfullwrong titleincomplete \fpreprint\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] Max Bain, Jaesung Huh, Tengda Han, and Andrew Zisserman.

We use GPT5 to help optimize language, correct\n\ngrammar and write LATEX table code.\n\n\u2022 Using an LLM as a research assistant. We use GPT5 to help search related works.\n\n\u2022 Using an LLM in our methods and experiment. This is described in the paper.\n\nA.2 Ethics Statement\n\nWe confirm that our study did not use any sensitive data where all data are public available. We have\nconducted this research and reported our findings responsibly. All results are presented transparently,\nincluding both performance gains and any observed limitations. We have diligently cited all relevant\nprior work and data sources to give proper credit and context. By following best practices in\ndocumentation and research integrity, we aim to contribute positively to the scientific community\nwhile upholding the highest ethical standards.\n\nA.3 Reproducibility statement\n\nWe are committed to ensuring the reproducibility of our results. All code and data needed to\nreproduce the experiments will be made publicly available. We will release this repository openly\nwith an appropriate open-source license upon publication. The datasets used in our experiments are\nstandard public benchmarks for language modeling and understanding (e.g., widely-used corpora and\nevaluation sets). These resources are readily accessible to other researchers.\n\nB Evaluation Metrics\n\nB.1 IP Memory\n\nWe propose a novel metric to evaluate how well an audience retains a work after watching its\npresentation video. Motivated by real-world conference interactions, this metric assesses whether\nan audience member, after viewing several presentation videos, can recall the work and pose a\nrelevant question when meeting the author.\n\nTo operationalize this, we construct video\u2013question pairs by sampling a five-second clip from each\npresentation video and selecting a corresponding understanding-level question from PresentQuiz. A\nVideoLLM serves as the audience proxy: it is presented with four randomly sampled video\u2013question\npairs, where the videos and questions are shuffled, together with an image of one speaker as the query.\nThe model is then asked to identify the relevant question to pose, and the accuracy quantifies the IP\nMemory score. Higher recall accuracy indicates that the generated results are more impressive and\nhold greater potential for lasting impact.\n\nC Experiment\n\nC.1 Video Results\n\nVideo results please refer to the supplementary materials.\n\nC.2 Results of Tree Search Visual Choice\n\nFigure 8 illustrates the slides before and after applying tree search visual choice refinement. The\nrefinement resolves the overfull issues and substantially improves slide quality, indicating that this\nmodule plays a crucial role in layout adjustment.\n\n14\n\n\fpreprint\n\nFigure 8: Slide Visualization of Tree Search Visual Choice. The first row shows slide results before\nlayout refinement, while the second row shows their corresponding slides after refinement.\nD Prompts\n\nPrompt: Slide Generation\n\nSystem Prompt: Please generate a complete English PPT introduction based on the following\nTeX source text content, using LaTeX Beamer.

The title page contains the paper title, author, institution,\nand date.\n\n\u2022 Key terms or mathematical symbols are highlighted with alert{}.\nImage and table processing:\n\u2022 All image paths are given, and relative paths are used when citing, the picture names must\n\n\"be consistent with the name in tex file\".\n\n\u2022 Images should automatically adapt to width, and add titles and labels\n\n\u2022 Experimental result tables should be extracted from the source text, formatted using tabular\n\nor booktabs environments, and marked with reference sources ( \"as shown in table\").\n\n15\n\nTree Search Visual Choice -RefinementBefore RefinementAfter Refinement\fpreprint\n\nCode generation requirements:\n\u2022 The generated LaTeX code must be complete and can be compiled directly (including\n\nnecessary structures).\n\n\u2022 Mark the source text location corresponding to each section in the code comments (for\n\nexample,\n\n\u2022 If there are mathematical formulas in the source text, they must be retained and correctly\n\nconverted to LaTeX syntax (such as y = f (x)).\n\nOther instructions:\n\u2022 Image content should be read from the tex file, and the source name should be used directly\nwithout arbitrary modification. Image references should use real image names and should\nnot be forged;\n\n\u2022 Table content should first extract real data from the source document.\n\n\u2022 All content should be in English.\n\n\u2022 If the source text is long, it is allowed to summarize the content, but the core methods,\n\nexperimental data and conclusions must be retained.\n\n\u2022 To enhance readability, a transition page can be added (for example, \"This section will\n\nintroduce the experimental part\").\n\n\u2022 Perfer more images than heavy text. **The number of slides should be around 10.**\n\u2022 **& in title is not allowed which will cause error \"Misplaced alignment tab character &\u00a8**\n\n**Pay attention to this \"error: !File ended while scanning use of frame\u00a8**\n\n\u2022 Only output latex code which should be ready to compile using tectonic(simple verson of\n\nTeX Live). Before output check if the code is grammatically correct.\n\nPrompt: Error Correction\n\nSystem Prompt: You are given a LaTeX Beamer code for the slides of a research paper and\nits error information. Correct these errors without changing the slide content (text, figures,\nlayout).\n\nInstructions:\n\n\u2022 Apply the minimal edits required to make the file compile: add missing packages,\nclose/open environments, balance braces, escape special characters, fix math delim-\niters, resolve duplicate labels, and correct obvious path or option typos.\n\n\u2022 Do not paraphrase or delete text; do not change figure/table content, captions, labels,\n\nor layout semantics.\n\n\u2022 Keep all image/table file names and relative paths as given; do not invent or rename\n\nassets.\n\n\u2022 Preserve the original Beamer theme, colors, and structure.\n\u2022 Ensure the final output compiles with Tectonic; close all environments and avoid\n\nundefined commands.\n\nOutput (strict): Output only the corrected LaTeX source, beginning with beamer and ending\nwith document; no extra commentary.\n\n16\n\n\fpreprint\n\nPrompt: MSTS Judge\n\nSystem Prompt: You are a slide layout judge. You see four slides A\u2013D in a 2\u00d72 grid: A\n(top-left), B (top-right), C (bottom-left), D (bottom-right).\n\nDefinitions\n\u2022 Overfull: any part of the figure or its caption is clipped, outside the frame, or over-\n\nlapped/hidden.\n\n\u2022 Coverage: among non-overfull options, larger visible content with less empty background\n\nis better.\n\n\u2022 Risk: risk of overfull decreases from A \u2192 D (A largest, D smallest).\n\u2022 Coverage trend: coverage decreases from A \u2192 D.\nRules (judge only the given images)\n1. Disqualify any option with overfull (caption must be fully visible).\n\n2. From the remaining, pick the one with the greatest coverage.\n3. Practical method: scan A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D; choose the first slide in that order that is not\n\noverfull.\n\nOutput only (strict; do not output \u201c\u2018json):\n{\n\"reason\": \"concise comparison\",\n\"choice\": \"A\" | \"B\" | \"C\" | \"D\"\n}\n\nPrompt: Slide Script with Cursor Positions\n\nSystem Prompt: You are an academic researcher presenting your own work at a research\nconference. You are provided with a sequence of adjacent slides.\n\nInstructions:\n\u2022 For each slide, write a smooth, engaging, and coherent first-person presentation script.\n\u2022 Clearly explain the current slide with academic clarity, brevity, and completeness; use a\n\nprofessional, formal tone and avoid content unrelated to the paper.\n\n\u2022 Each sentence must include exactly one cursor position description drawn from the current\nslide and listed in order, using the format script | cursor description. If no\ncursor is needed for a sentence, write no.\n\n\u2022 Limit the total script for each slide to 50 words or fewer.\n\u2022 Separate slides using the delimiter ###.\n\nOutput Format (strict):\nsentence 1 | cursor description\nsentence 2 | cursor description\n...\n###\nsentence 1 | cursor description\n...\n\n17\n\n\fpreprint\n\nPrompt: Meta Similarity\n\nSystem Prompt: You are an evaluator. You will be given two presentation videos of the same\ntalk: (1) a human-presented version and (2) an AI-generated version.

Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,\nespecially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the\nsearch distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses\nprobability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single\nhigh-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking\npersists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.\nTo address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework\nfor LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning\ndynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by\nblock-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token\ndistributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely\nconvergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,\nSwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying\nproblem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,\nSwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across\nreasoning LLMs of different model families and scales.

A major issue is the lack of access to high-quality\ntraining data that reflect the learning of actual students. Prompt engineering has emerged\nas a stopgap, but the ability of prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-\nbased natural language is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM \u2013 an\nLLM optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art models.\nTeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000 hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-\ntutor interactions maintained by Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process\nto protect privacy. We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model\nthat enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student\u2013tutor dialogues. Building on this\ncapability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol that leverages synthetic dialogue\ngeneration to provide fast, scalable, and reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities\nof LLMs. Our evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data significantly\nimproves conversational and pedagogical performance \u2013 doubling student talk time, improving\nquestioning style, increasing dialogue turns by 50%, and greater personalization of instruction.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn his seminal 1984 study, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom demonstrated that one-on-one\ntutoring can yield learning gains two standard deviations above those achieved through traditional\nclassroom instruction [1]. Given the high cost of personalized tutoring, the advent of generative AI\nhas raised hopes of scaling effective one-on-one learning to students worldwide [2\u20136]. Yet despite\nthe rapid adoption of AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude by millions of learners [7, 8],\nthese technologies have so far failed to realize that promise [9]. For instance, a recent University of\nPennsylvania study found that unfettered access to GPT-4 for math tutoring can harm educational\noutcomes [10]. Similarly, an MIT study reported that participants who used LLMs exhibited\nsignificantly reduced brain connectivity and struggled to quote from answers they wrote just minutes\nearlier [11].\n\n\u2217janos@polygence.org (Corresponding author)\n\u2020jin@polygence.org\n\u2021ddemszky@stanford.edu\n\n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fFigure 1: Left: Illustration of the Polygence program and project outcomes. Students meet online\nwith tutors pursuing or holding advanced degrees (PhD, MD, JD, MBA, etc.) to take projects\nfrom ideation, to exection, to showcasing. Project outcomes range from academic papers to creating\npodcasts to engineering physical devices. Topics range from AI to cancer biology to sport analytics.\nRight: Top 10 institutions represented by the advanced degrees pursued or held by Polygence tutors.\n\nA fundamental issue with LLMs is that they have been optimized to act as \u201chelpful assistants\u201d\nthat maximize productivity and minimize cognitive labor [12\u201320]. This contrasts with the natural\nfriction that expert teachers introduce into learning (for example, by withholding the right answer\nand prompting students to first attempt a response) [21\u201323]. Effective tutoring also requires dy-\nnamic adaptation to learners\u2019 states of mind as opposed to one-size-fits-all instructional designs [24].\nThis tendency toward friction minimization and sycophantic behavior\u2014prioritizing compliance over\npedagogy\u2014is systematically encoded in model parameters through supervised fine-tuning [12] and\nreinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [25, 26]. These processes rely on datasets\nproduced by human annotators instructed to provide responses that maximize completeness while\nminimizing the number of conversational turns [15].\n\nOff-the-shelf LLMs can be steered towards improved pedagogy to a limited extent through\nprompt engineering [27\u201332], but prompting alone cannot resolve the underlying issues. No finite\nset of rules or instructions, however sophisticated, can capture the complexity and nuance of high-\nquality human pedagogy, which necessarily adapts to diverse learners, study contexts, and student\ngoals [33]. We encountered these limitations first-hand in our attempts to build a project-based\ntutor\u2014called Polypilot\u2014with GPT-4, where iterative prompt refinement led to an endless cycle\nof increasingly elaborate instructions in response to new scenarios and edge cases. Such peda-\n\n2\n\n\fgogical constraints persist even in the most recent education-focused LLMs, including Anthropic\u2019s\nLearning Mode [28], OpenAI\u2019s Study Mode [29], and Google\u2019s Guided Learning [30] (integrating\nLearnLM [31]). For example, when confronted with student confusion, these models typically de-\nfault to rephrasing the problem rather than diagnosing its underlying source. Similar challenges\narise in prompt-engineered student simulators, which typically lack the authenticity and diversity\nneeded to represent the full spectrum of learning personas [34].\n\nPost-training frontier models on domain-specific data has recently led to rapid progress toward\nhuman-level performance across a range of domains, including coding, law, and science [35\u201338].\nThis progress has been made possible by the availability of copious amounts of high-quality training\ndata generated by human annotators who adhere to clearly defined standards of excellence [39]. We\nexpect similar progress to be possible in education given sufficient availability of training data and\nwell-defined success metrics [40]. Recently, Google\u2019s LearnLM team demonstrated that supervised\nfine-tuning of LLMs on synthetic data can improve their performance on a range of education-related\nbenchmarks [33]. Post-training LLMs for education is especially important given that modeling\neffective pedagogical behavior inherently entails both an expert teacher and an authentic learner.\nWithout access to a realistic student model\u2014either a high-fidelity simulator or real students, the\nlatter being hard to scale and ethically problematic\u2014benchmarking candidate teacher models is\nseverely limited.\n\nA persistent challenge for post-training educational models is the scarcity of authentic learning\ndata from human teachers and students due to logistical barriers, privacy protections, and concerns\nabout data quality [41\u201350]. Moreover, human annotators cannot reliably simulate the active learn-\ning processes of students or replicate expert teacher practices without engaging with real learners,\nmaking the on-demand collection of such data particularly difficult. To address these limitations,\nresearchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Cornell University have launched the Na-\ntional Tutoring Observatory [51], with support from the Gates Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg\nInitiative [52], and the National Science Foundation [53]. The initiative aims to collect and open-\nsource one million teacher\u2013student interactions to inform the development of AI tutoring tools [51].\nWhile this represents an important step toward alleviating the critical shortage of educational\ntraining data, additional work will be required to realize the full potential of post-training models\nin education.\n\nIn this preliminary report, we present a case study on post-training LLMs for education, drawing\non data from the Polygence platform [54] consisting of over 100,000 hours of one-on-one, project-\nbased tutoring sessions between PhD-level tutors and students across more than 150 subjects\n(Fig. 1). Data was curated consistent with the platform\u2019s terms of use and privacy policy, reflecting\nparticipant opt-outs, and underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy. Using\nthis dataset, we fine-tune a high-fidelity student model to benchmark frontier LLMs on six multi-\nturn conversational and pedagogical evaluations. We also fine-tune a teacher model, TeachLM, and\ndemonstrate that it significantly outperforms off-the-shelf models on these benchmarks. Our main\ncontributions are as follows:\n\n1. We develop a pipeline for transcribing, diarizing, and cleaning single-track audio recordings\n\nto produce high-quality dialogical data for post-training.\n\n2. We show that student data enables the training of authentic student models, which are\n\nessential for scalable and reproducible evaluation of LLMs\u2019 pedagogical capabilities.\n\n3. We benchmark off-the-shelf LLMs against human tutors across six education-focused evalua-\n\ntions, highlighting systematic differences in conversational and engagement metrics.\n\n3\n\n\f4. We demonstrate that parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art LLMs on authentic\n\nlearning data substantially improves their pedagogical performance.\n\nWe conclude by outlining the limitations of our current approach and identifying next steps for\n\nrefining the post-training process and evaluating its efficacy.\n\n2 Background: Improving LLM Pedagogy\n\nAddressing the pedagogical limitations of LLMs through both post-training and prompt engineering\nhas been an active area of research. Below we review a few of these efforts.\n\n2.1 LearnLM: Google\u2019s Fine-Tuned Model\n\nA pioneering effort by Google\u2019s LearnLM team [55] has focused on improving LLMs for education\nby post-training. Their early efforts focused on the targeted collection of human tutoring data\nand the generation of synthetic data under the guidance of education experts [33]. While the\non-demand collection of human contractor data from impersonating students proved too noisy\nfor training, their synthetic data allowed the training of an LLM optimized for pedagogy, called\nLearnLM [33]. LearnLM demonstrated improvements across a range of measurable benchmarks,\nsuch as guiding students to answers, promoting engagement, or identifying misconceptions [33].\nWhile synthetic data alone cannot fully capture the nuances of effective human pedagogy and\nauthentic student learning, these improvements highlight the promise of using domain-specific data\nfor post-training LLMs for education. Recently, the LearnLM Team at Google has shifted its\nfocus from post-hoc fine-tuning of models to optimizing it for pedagogical instruction following of\nteacher- or developer-defined prompts [56]. While acknowledging the shortcomings of prompting,\nthey explained their decision citing the \u2018prohibitively difficult\u2019 challenge of defining ideal AI tutoring\nbehavior, instead leaving it to teachers and developers to decide on the desired behavior [56]. They\nalso highlighted the cost and overhead of maintaining fine-tuned models while base models are\ndeveloping rapidly [56].\n\n2.2 PolyPilot: Polygence\u2019s Prompt-Engineered Tutor\n\nWe first experienced the limitations of prompt engineering through a high-conviction internal prod-\nuct experiment in early 2024, when a dedicated engineering and product team at Polygence [54]\nbuilt Polypilot \u2014- a dynamically prompt-engineered project-based tutor using GPT-4. PolyPilot\nwas deployed in production after many months of user feedback and iterative development, and we\ncollected detailed feedback from more than 70 engaged users (see Appendix A).\n\nGiven that Polygence specializes in high-quality project-based tutoring (the success of which\ncan be judged by students\u2019 ability to deliver showcaseable artifacts), we quickly recognized the lim-\nitations of our prompt-engineered tutor and its ability to steer students towards a project outcome.\nWe invested several months of deliberate effort to iteratively refine stage-dependent prompts and\nwe combined the LLM with sophisticated user interfaces and constantly gathered user feedback\nto guide our experimentation. However, we soon reached the conclusion that the gap between a\nhuman tutor and GPT-4 was simply too large to be closed by prompt engineering. Even relatively\nsimple tasks, such as varying the number and placement of questions or avoiding \u201cwall-of-text\u201d\nresponses to better mirror human tutors, proved inconsistent with prompting. We continued our\nexperimentation with GPT-4o, o1, Gemini 1.5, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and progressively introduced\ncomplex RAG-based approaches to provide LLMs with high-quality examples. However, by early\n\n4\n\n\f2025 we concluded that, despite the rapid improvement of LLMs, prompt engineering of off-the-\nshelf models continues to be insufficient to build a product that can meet the standard of human\ntutoring.\n\n2.3 Anthropic\u2019s Learning Mode, OpenAI\u2019s Study Mode, and Google\u2019s Guided\n\nLearning\n\nIn recent months, large model developers have released educational LLMs that have been prompt-\nengineered to improve their pedagogical behavior. Examples include Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 4\nwith Learning Mode [28], OpenAI\u2019s GPT 5 with Study Mode [29], and Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro\nwith Guided Learning [30] (which integrates LearnLM [31]). None of these customized LLMs are\navailable through application programming interfaces (APIs), making rigorous, large-scale, and\nrepeatable evaluation of these models difficult. Nonetheless, to get a directional sense of their\nbehavior, we manually tested all three LLMs via multi-turn conversations dozens of times with\ndifferent learning scenarios (see Appendix B for more details).\n\nBased on our experimentation, our informal assessment of these educational modes is that their\npedagogical capabilities remain rudimentary, and are noticeably constrained by the limitations\nof rule-based prompt engineering. For example, we found that these models often miss students\u2019\nlearning context, default to multiple-choice-style questioning rather than asking open questions, give\naway answers, fail to appropriately address confusion, and struggle with verbosity. We also found\nthat models from different providers exhibit remarkably similar behavioral patterns \u2013 highlighting\nboth the limited power of prompt engineering to overwrite the pedagogy-agnostic principles learned\nfrom large-scale training data and the likely consequence of major AI labs sourcing data from the\nsame vendors (e.g., Scale AI, Surge AI, and Mercor [57]).\n\n3 Curating Authentic Learning Data for Post-training\n\nAfter experiencing the limitations of prompt engineering while building PolyPilot, our focus shifted\ntoward post-training LLMs on authentic learning data from Polygence.\n\n3.1 Authentic Learning Dataset\n\nThe Polygence dataset comprises more than 100,000 hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student\u2013tutor\ninteractions in multiple modalities. This data was collected through the Polygence platform [54]\nconsistent with the platform\u2019s terms and conditions while honoring opt-outs (see Section 3.2) and\nunderwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy. The Polygence platform supports\nan online program for one-on-one project-based learning under the guidance of expert, PhD-level\nUS-based mentors. Students join Polygence to engage in projects covering a wide array of subjects\nboth in STEM and in the Humanities.\nIllustrative projects include building a cardboard wind\ntunnel [60], sewing a historically accurate 19th-century dress [61], writing a paper on using AI to\nstandardize ballet teaching [62], recording a podcast about the neuroscience of dementia [63], and\ncreating a helmet with an AI-powered concussion detection system [64] (see Fig. 1). The projects\nare overseen by PhD-level experts from top US research institutions. The top 10 institutions\nrepresented are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nThis dataset represents a distinct opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of training LLMs on\n\nauthentic learning data because of its unique characteristics:\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: A squarified hierarchical map of the distribution of project topics based on a random\nsample of n = 1, 000 Polygence projects. To create this map, we used a customized version of\nK-means clustering of project topics based on Anthropic\u2019s Clio framework [58] and the open-source\nKura library [59]. The size of each box is proportional to the relative frequency of each topic or\ntopic cluster.\n\n\u2022 Longitudinal interactions: Projects typically last 4\u20136 months and capture the entire learn-\ning process, including the development of student\u2013tutor relationships over time\u2014a key driver\nof instructional effectiveness [65\u201367].\n\n\u2022 Full personalization: Each project is tailored to the student\u2019s academic needs and goals.\n\n\u2022 Multi-modal exchanges: Each project\u2019s dataset encompasses meeting transcripts, shared\n\ndocuments, chat, and other modalities of student\u2013tutor interaction.\n\n\u2022 Outcome-oriented projects: Over 80% of completed projects culminate in a showcaseable\nartifact, such as an academic paper, video, podcast, physical prop, or GitHub repository (see\nFig. 1).\n\n\u2022 Alignment with student AI usage: Approximately 80% of the tutoring activities overlap\n\nwith the top 10 student use cases of AI reported by OpenAI [7].\n\nTo understand the distribution of topics and activities covered in Polygence sessions, we apply K-\nmeans clustering to the session transcripts using Anthropic\u2019s Clio framework [58] and a customized\nversion of the open-source Kura library [59]. First, we focus on a high-level overview of the diverse\n\n6\n\n\fFigure 3: Tutoring activity overview for n = 195 completed 10-session projects.

We randomly sample n = 1, 000 projects and cluster\nthem based on their project topics. Fig. 2 shows that the majority of the topics cover computer\nscience, biomedical topics, psychology and neuroscience. The most popular topic is AI and machine\nlearning followed by cancer research.\n\nNext, we focus on the various tutoring activities that are undertaken during the live sessions. We\nselect a representative subset of n = 195 completed projects, which typically have 9-10 full sessions.\nWe then divide each 1-hour session into 10\u201315 segments, each about 5 minutes long (n = 24, 587\n\n7\n\n\fchunks in total) and recursively classify them to obtain both lower-level (more specific) and higher-\nlevel categories of topics and activities.\n\nFig. 3 highlights how the distribution of activities between the tutor and the student shifts\ndynamically as the project progresses across the ten sessions. Rapport and relationship building\nrepresents up to 25% of the first session and up to 10% of the last session and remains an impor-\ntant part of the mentoring process throughout the ten sessions (e.g. providing encouragement and\nemotional support). Ideation and setting project goals and scope are heavily prioritized upfront,\nbut remain 10-20% of the time budget up to mid-way through the project \u2013 showing the highly\niterative nature of this process. Subject-specific tutoring (e.g. explaining AI concepts) and techni-\ncal guidance (e.g. coding and data analysis) account for about a quarter of all time spent on the\nproject and is evenly distributed across the entire process. Reviewing artifacts (e.g. writing and\npresentation feedback) gradually increases in importance as the project progresses. These details\nhighlight the highly dynamic and iterative nature of these projects as well as the richness of longi-\ntudinal tutor-student interactions that are difficult to capture in simple, static rules or heuristics.\nTable 1 gives a detailed breakdown of each high-level activity into more specific activities.\n\nThis detailed activity map of a representative sample of tens of thousands of 5-minute session\nfragments allows us to map the tutoring activity on the Polygence platform to the top 27 categories\nof ChatGPT usage by 18-24 year old students, as reported by OpenAI [7]. By introducing the\nOpenAI-defined categories into our clustering process, we find that approximately 78% of our\ndata covers the top 10 ChatGPT use cases by students. These include starting papers/projects,\nbrainstorming creative projects, exploring topics, editing writing, solving mathematical problems,\nconducting academic research, tutoring, and drafting essays (see Appendix C for more details).\n\n3.2 Data privacy, User Consent, Anonymization, and Data Security\n\nData was collected and processed consistent with our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and reflects\nparticipant opt-outs. In addition to the rights granted through these policies, we secure consent\nfor every recorded session with explicit, real-time notification of participants about recording at\nthe start of each call. Given that some tutor profiles may be publicly associated with Polygence,\nwe took certain steps to anonymize their identities in the transcripts and remove information\nthat could personally identify them (PII) before training, including their personal background,\neducation, life experiences, academic expertise, personal opinions, etc. This data anonymization\nwas done on Polygence\u2019s internal servers. All subsequent experimentation and model evaluation was\nconducted exclusively on our service provider\u2019s enterprise-grade platforms. Those service providers\nare contractually required to maintain confidentiality, ensure appropriate data security protections\nfor the data, and are prohibited from using Polygence\u2019s data for their own AI model training.\n\n3.3 Transcription, Diarization, and Cleaning\n\nOur training pipeline is built on audio from tutoring sessions, recorded with the explicit consent\nof all participants as outlined in our consent framework (Section 3.2). High-quality training data\nis a prerequisite for effective post-training. Prior work shows that quality outweighs quantity\nduring fine-tuning (e.g., [68]). We apply a multi-step pipeline to clean and post-process audio and\ntranscripts from tutoring sessions before text-based fine-tuning.\n\nData pre-filtering. We retain projects with a single, uninterrupted tutor\u2013student match. We\nutilize dual-track Zoom recordings (separate tracks per speaker), a feature that enables higher-\nfidelity transcription and reliable diarization.\n\n8\n\n\fFigure 4: End-to-end transcript processing pipeline. Dual-track audio is merged and trimmed, then\ntranscribed with high fidelity. Speaker activity masks enable accurate diarization, followed by a\nmulti-step cleaning process (fix punctuation and grammar, remove backchannels and interruptions,\nalign context and tutor persona, and improve coherence and enforce turn taking) to yield polished\ntutor\u2013student transcripts.\n\nAudio transcription and diarization. As illustrated in Fig. 4:\n\n1. Assign single-speaker tracks to Tutor or Student via fuzzy matching of Zoom display\n\nnames to known participants.\n\n2. Merge tracks into one file and trim leading/trailing silence for all files to reduce transcription\n\nhallucinations from long gaps.\n\n3. Transcribe the merged two-speaker audio with ElevenLabs\u2019 API [69], which yields high-fidelity\n\ntext (including fillers) but unreliable speaker tags.\n\n4. Derive per-speaker activity masks from the single-speaker tracks.\n\n5. Attribute each utterance to the speaker with maximal temporal overlap; compile a diarized\n\ntranscript with one speaker per statement.\n\n6. Generate multiple transcript candidates and select the best using a reasoning model (Gemini\n\n2.5 Pro), mitigating rare but consequential ASR lapses (e.g., dropped segments).\n\nTranscript cleaning. Using a reasoning model (Gemini 2.5 Pro), we apply:\n\n1. Normalization of punctuation and grammar.\n\n2. Removal of backchannels that interrupt flow (e.g., \u201cyeah\u201d, \u201cgotcha\u201d, \u201cuh-huh\u201d).\n\n3. Context adjustments and anonymization by removing or reframing references to human tutor\nidentity, personal anecdotes, comments related to physical embodiment, platform names, and\nprogram-specific details.\n\n9\n\n\f4. Coherence smoothing and enforced turn-taking by merging consecutive same-speaker utter-\n\nances.\n\nFinally, we conduct human spot checks to ensure transcripts meet the quality bar for post-\n\ntraining.\n\n4 Multi-turn Evaluations Using a Fine-Tuned Student Model\n\nBeyond sufficient high-quality data, effective fine-tuning also requires a clear measure of good\nperformance. A persistent issue in evaluating LLMs pedagogical performance is the lack of industry-\nwide standards for multi-turn evaluations [70, 71]. This contrasts with single-turn evaluations,\nwhich have become ubiquitous in the generative AI industry, including within the educational\ndomain [31, 33, 56]. Here we introduce (i) a set of proxies for high-quality pedagogy in multi-turn\ndialogues, and (ii) a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol that combines a fine-tuned student model\nand a fine-tuned tutor model to generate a large number of synthetic dialogues. Each of these\ndialogues are then evaluated using traditional, single-shot evaluation methods and the results are\nthen aggregated. These stochastic methods represent fast, scalable and reproducible measures of\nLLMs multi-turn performance.\n\n4.1 Defining Proxies for High-Quality Pedagogy\n\nA major challenge in education research is the lack of universally accepted pedagogical best prac-\ntices [33, 72\u201375]. While certain behaviors are commonly cited as markers of effective teaching\n(e.g., not giving away the answer, asking questions, balancing talk time), good pedagogy is highly\ncontext-dependent, making simple heuristics insufficient to capture the full spectrum of quality\ninstruction. Nevertheless, advancing LLM training requires well-defined evaluation criteria, and\nthus it is necessary to select at least some practical proxies for high-quality pedagogy.\n\nIn this preliminary case study, we focus on a handful of straightforward benchmarks, deferring\nmore complex evaluations to future work. Our choice of benchmarks was informed by (i) prior\nacademic studies (see below) and (ii) extensive user feedback from our PolyPilot experiment (see\nSection 2.2). Specifically, we highlight the following benchmarks:\n\n\u2022 Student talk-time: The percentage of words uttered by the student relative to the total\nnumber of words in the dialogue. In a large-scale randomized controlled trial on the Poly-\ngence platform, increasing student talk time was positively associated with outcomes such as\nacademic confidence and participant satisfaction [76].\n\n\u2022 Average number of words per tutor turn: A measure closely tied to talk time, used\nto detect the prevalence of \u201cwall-of-text\u201d responses, a well-documented issue in LLM out-\nputs [77\u201379].\n\n\u2022 Mean questions per interrogative turn: PolyPilot user feedback highlighted that LLMs\noften display unnatural questioning styles such as asking a series of questions in the same\nturn. This metric captures the average number of questions per interrogative turn and serves\nas a proxy for human-like questioning practices, such as favoring open-ended inquiries. An\ninterrogative turn is defined as a statement that has at least one question and questions are\ndetected via question marks.\n\n\u2022 Number of turns before wrap-up: LLMs are typically trained to resolve queries as quickly\nas possible, which can limit their ability to sustain extended and meaningful educational\n\n10\n\n\fdialogue. This metric is defined as the number of student and tutor turns before the tutor\nindicates that the discussion is over (e.g. telling the student to do the assigned work and\nreport back when they are done).\n\n\u2022 Uncovering student background and learning context: LLMs frequently suffer from\nthe \u201cfirst mile problem\u201d\u2014jumping into explanations without first eliciting information about\nthe student\u2019s academic background or learning goals [80] (also see Appendix B). To evaluate\nthis proxy, we track what percentage of all known information about a student is uncovered\nby a tutor during a dialogue. To do so, we extract and tabulate the information learned\nabout the student in the original human-to-human conversation, which we treat as the theo-\nretical maximum of 100%. We note that even the most skilled teachers would score less than\n100% on this benchmark as every conversation is unique and uncovers a slightly different\nset of facts about the student. Nevertheless, this provides a directional measure of improve-\nment in uncovering relevant information about the student (i.e., higher scores indicate better\nperformance).\n\n\u2022 Checking coding skills for coding projects: A targeted version of the previous bench-\nmark, this tests whether the model probes a student\u2019s coding proficiency (a binary yes/no\ndecision) before initiating technical projects. Our data indicates that nearly all human tutors\nbegin by carefully assessing their students\u2019 coding backgrounds and even with thoughtful cal-\nibration of project difficulty, about 20% of coding projects still encounter challenges related\nto scope or student skill.\n\nThese benchmarks are intentionally simple, and in principle, any LLM could \u201cace\u201d them through\nprompt-engineered rules (e.g., \u201calways ask about the student\u2019s coding background before starting a\ncomputational project\u201d). However, they serve only as proxies for educational quality. Our central\nthesis is that a model with strong pedagogical capabilities would perform well on these metrics,\nbut optimizing solely for them does not guarantee high-quality teaching.\n\n4.2 Fine-Tuned Student Model\n\nSimulating students using generative AI is an active area of research, with prompt engineering being\nthe prominent method of creating different student personas [43, 81\u201384]. We generally expect stu-\ndents to be easier to simulate than teacher models [34, 43], due to the fact that in most educational\ndialogues students are expected to follow instructions (similar to LLMs) as opposed to leading\nwith instructions. However, prompt-engineered student simulators often lack the authenticity and\nvariety that is needed to capture a wide range of different learning personas [34].\n\nIn our approach, we use student data to train a student model through parameter-efficient fine-\ntuning (PEFT) [85, 86]. This approach was inspired by the empirical realization that even human\ntesters with relevant domain-expertise (e.g. the authors of this paper) are low-fidelity impersonators\nof students. At the same time, with access to extensive dialogue data about how students talk,\nbehave and learn in actual sessions it is possible to train representative student models that mimic\nhuman learners with high fidelity, including the conversational benchmarks outlined in Section 4.1.\n\nThe steps of training a fine-tuned student model are as follows:\n\n1. We select a large, random sample of projects. We assign non-descript ID\u2019s to track each\n\nproject during the training process.\n\n2. We perform multiple epochs of supervised fine-tuning on the student turns in these transcripts\nwith a system prompt that contains the project ID, stopping the training before overfitting\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 5: Comparing three core conversational statistics (talk time, questions per turn, words per\nturn) across four different types of dialogues: human to human, human to GPT-4, base student\nmodel (Gemini 2.0 Flash) to GPT-4, and tuned student model (Gemini 2.0 Flash tuned on Poly-\ngence student data) to GPT-4. The human-to-GPT-4 conversational data was obtained from our\nPolyPilot experiment (Section 2.2). We observe that simulated conversations between two prompt-\nengineered base models (large orange dot) produce significantly different (p < 0.001) conversational\nstatistics from both dialogues involving only humans (green dashed line) and a human student and\nAI (red dotted line). Fine-tuning a model on student data (connected blue dots) progressively aligns\nits conversational statistics with those of actual humans conversing with AI (red dotted line). Hu-\nmans interacting with AI also produces different conversational statistics than human-to-human\nconversations, highlighting that the prompt engineered base tutor model (GPT-4) impersonates a\nhuman tutor with limited fidelity. These results provide further evidence that simulated dialogues\ninvolving a fine-tuned student model approximate human-AI conversations better than conversa-\ntions generated from two prompt-engineered AI models alone. Error bars and intervals represent\n95% confidence intervals calculated with the Student\u2019s t-distribution (light green and light red in-\ntervals show the error bars for human-to-human and human-to-GPT-4 conversations respectively).\n\nbegins. This training on a large amount of student data gives the model a general sense\nof how students typically communicate and behave, while also ingraining individual student\nbehavior into the model parameters.\n\n3. We randomly choose a small subset of students (n = 10) for actual simulations and selectively\nactivate them by using exactly the same prompt \u2013including the associated project-specific ID\u2013\nthat was used during the fine-tuning phase.\n\n4. In addition, we use an LLM to extract a comprehensive set of details that the student reveals\nabout themselves during the student-tutor conversation and include it in the system prompt.\nThis further reinforces the fine-tuned behavior of the student.\n\n5. We run single-shot evaluations on the student model to confirm that it responds to a set of\n\nselected queries as expected.\n\nUpon completing training, we carry out qualitative and quantitative assessments to verify that\nthe model\u2019s behavior closely reflects that of the original students. Qualitative checks performed by\nPolygence personnel confirm that these fine-tuned and prompt-reinforced student models respond\nto questions about their academic background, project interests, etc. in a similar style as their live\ncounterparts.\n\n12\n\n\fA summary of our quantitative checks is provided in Fig. 5. Specifically, in Fig. 5 we study\nthe conversational statistics that emerge when this fine-tuned student model is paired with an off-\nthe-shelf model (GPT-4) and compare the results in three other scenarios: (1) human-to-human\ninteractions, (2) human-to-AI interactions, and (3) AI-to-AI interactions without fine-tuning. We\nspecifically picked GPT-4 for this analysis because it allows us to use the conversational human-\nto-AI data from our PolyPilot experiment (see Section 2.2) for benchmarking.\n\nCrucially, we find that simulated conversations between two AI base models (Base Student\nModel to GPT-4, large orange dot) produce markedly different conversational statistics from\nboth dialogues involving only humans (Human to Human, green dashed line) and those between\nhumans and an AI tutor (Human to GPT-4, red dotted line). A one-way Analysis of Variance\n(ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s HSD post-hoc tests confirmed that these differences are highly\nstatistically significant.\n\nWhen interacting with GPT-4, the student base model talks less overall than a human student\nwith a human tutor (mean of 22.2% vs. 29.9%, a difference of \u22127.7 percentage points, p < 0.001). At\nthe same time, it talks substantially more than a human student interacting with GPT-4 (22.2%\nvs. 10.5%, a difference of +11.8 p.p., p < 0.001). Furthermore, the base model also includes\nsignificantly more questions per turn (mean of 1.91) than both the Human-to-AI scenario (+1.47\nquestions, p < 0.001) and the Human-to-Human scenario (+0.80 questions, p < 0.001). Finally,\nthe base model\u2019s turns are substantially longer, averaging 66.1 words, which is significantly more\nthan both the Human-to-AI scenario (+40.5 words, p < 0.001) and the Human-to-Human scenario\n(+42.6 words, p < 0.001). Notably, while the base model is a clear outlier on this metric, the average\nturn lengths for the Human-to-AI (25.5 words) and Human-to-Human (23.4 words) conditions were\nnot statistically different from one another (p = 0.589).\n\nIn contrast, after training on our student data, the fine-tuned student model displays conver-\nsational statistics that begin to mimic those of humans interacting with AI. These results indicate\nthat simulated dialogues involving a fine-tuned student model provide a more accurate represen-\ntation of human-AI conversations than those generated from two prompt-engineered AI models\nalone.\n\n4.3 Multi-Turn Evaluations\n\nOur student simulator allows us to run multi-turn evaluations at scale on any LLMs. First, we\npick a single fine-tuned student model by selecting a training checkpoint that performs well on\nour evaluations and that is well aligned with human-to-AI conversational statistics (Fig. 5). We\nthen initiate a conversation between the student model and a tutor model that we are looking to\nevaluate by feeding the output of the tutor model into the student model and vice versa. This\ncontinues until either the end of the conversation is detected by a dedicated LLM judge (Gemini\n2.5 Flash), or the number of turns hit a predetermined limit (this ensures that conversations do not\ncontinue indefinitely). Once the conversation is finished, it is analyzed for conversational statistics\nand passed on to a reasoning LLM judge for a single-shot evaluation (see e.g. \u2018Uncovering student\nbackground & learning context\u2019 in Section 4.1). We typically repeat this 10 times for each of\nthe 10 student models, thereby ensuring that each evaluation point corresponds to 100 simulated\nmulti-turn conversations. We chose these numbers to limit variability and to ensure reproducibility\nbetween consecutive evaluation experiments.\n\n13\n\n\f5 Benchmarking LLMs Against Human Performance\n\nBefore fine-tuning LLMs with authentic learning data, we first sought to evaluate the performance\ngap between state-of-the-art LLMs and humans in terms of conversational and pedagogical capa-\nbilities. To establish human performance for the six selected benchmarks outlined in the previous\nsection, we analyze 80,000 hours of data from Polygence. We also evaluate off-the-shelf LLMs\nfor the same benchmarks. Our methodology for performing these evaluations using a fine-tuned\nstudent model is discussed in Section 4.3.\n\nFigure 6: Benchmarking results for six conversational and pedagogical metrics comparing human\ntutors (hatched gray) with state-of-the-art LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, and XAI.\nBenchmarks include (a) student talk time, (b) average words per tutor turn, (c) mean questions\nper interrogative turn, (d) number of turns before wrap-up, (e) uncovering student background\nand learning context, and (f) checking coding skills for coding projects. Human tutors consistently\noutperform LLMs across these benchmarks.\n\nFig. 6 shows our benchmarking results for humans (hatched gray) and a range of different\nstate-of-the-art LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, and XAI. In Fig. 6(a), we find\nthat in human-to-human tutor-led dialogues students speak close to 30% of the time. Off-the-shelf\nmodels are typically more verbose than humans, leaving only 5-15% of talk time to students. A\nhallmark of dynamic dialogues is when students and tutors take frequent turns, rather than one\nparty monopolizing the conversation. Fig. 6(b) shows that on average, human tutors speak only 72\nwords before passing the turn to the student. In contrast, most off-the-shelf models average 150-300\n\n14\n\n\fwords per turn. Another important technique in human tutoring is asking open-ended questions\nand then pausing and letting students answer. Statistically speaking, human tutors typically ask\n1-2 questions per interrogative turn (on average 1.5 in our dataset). In Fig. 6(c) we observe the\ninherent tendency of LLMs to ask a high number of questions (3-4 per interrogative turn). Another\nshortcoming of LLMs is the rapid drive towards \u2018resolving\u2019 conversations. Fig. 6(d) shows that most\nLLMs tend to end student conversations in 30-80 turns, which contrasts with human tutors, whose\naverage session length is closer to 150-160 turns (note that session lengths are widely distributed,\nwith a mean of 56 minutes and a standard deviation of 16 minutes despite the nominal 1-hour\nlength).\n\nFig. 6(e) shows our most complex evaluation, which quantifies the extent to which off-the-\nshelf frontier models are able to uncover relevant information about the student\u2019s background and\nlearning context. We find that most models score in the 40-45% interval, often missing key context\n(such as coding skills, goals, needs, motivation, etc.) about the student.\n\nFig. 6(f) shows results for a more specific version of the previous benchmark \u2013 the tendency of\nmodels to check the student\u2019s the coding background in cases where their project requires coding\n(a binary yes/no decision). Human data shows that tutors check students\u2019 coding background\nvirtually any time the project involves coding. In contrast, we find that most off-the-shelf models\nperform in the 50-80% range, with only a few thinking models doing better.\n\nFinally, we note that these benchmarking experiments have generally proven reproducible across\nruns and across different versions of our student model. For example, we consistently find that\namong the models we analyzed, Claude produces the highest student talk time, LearnLM maintains\nthe conversation the longest, and GPT-5 (and previously o1) performs the best on checking the\ncoding skills of the student.\n\n6 Fine-Tuning on Authentic Learning Data\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate that performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning [85, 86] on state-\nof-the-art frontier models using high-quality post-training data (see Section 3) improves their per-\nformance on the benchmarks outlined in Section 4.1. Specifically, we fine-tune Google\u2019s Gemini\n2.5 Flash and OpenAI\u2019s GPT 4o-08-06, both of which are state-of-the-art models and are the most\nrecent non-thinking model versions1 from their respective providers with API access to fine-tuning.\n\n6.1 Benchmarking through automatic evaluations\n\nFig. 9 shows a representative set of results of our fine-tuning experiments across the six different\nbenchmarks under consideration. The dashed green line shows results from the human training\ndata for reference (note that these results are slightly different from Fig. 6 due to the effects of\nthe cleaning process outlined in Section 3.3). We see that fine-tuning improves model performance\non every benchmark, bringing the resulting values closer to the human training data benchmarks.\nSpecifically, we find that student talk time increases, the average number of words per tutor turn\ngoes down, the mean number of question per interrogative turn settles in the 1-2 question region2,\nand the number of conversation turns increases. We also find that models show marked improve-\nments on the complex evaluation of uncovering student background and learning context, although\n\n1For Gemini 2.5 Flash we set the thinking budget to zero tokens.\n2Note that GPT-4o-2024-0806 ask comparatively fewer questions (around 1.3) per interrogative turn than other\noff-the-shelf models. Nonetheless, fine-tuning changes how it is formulating its questions. We found that later models\nfrom OpenAI \u2013 such as GPT-4o-2024-11-20, o1, and GPT-5\u2013 regress to asking 3-4 questions per interrogative turn.\n\n15\n\n\fFigure 7: Fine-tuning results on six conversational and pedagogical benchmarks for Gemini 2.5\nFlash (orange) and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 (blue). The dashed green line indicates performance from\nhuman training data. Benchmarks include (a) student talk time, (b) average words per tutor\nturn, (c) mean questions per interrogative turn, (d) number of turns before wrap-up, (e) uncov-\nering student background and learning context, and (f) checking coding skills for coding projects.\nFine-tuning consistently improves model performance, with simpler conversational metrics (a\u2013d)\nconverging more quickly than the more complex pedagogical benchmarks (e\u2013f).\n\nthe absolute values are still far from 100%. We also find a corresponding improvement on the\ncoding skill check benchmark.\n\nThe x-axes in Figs. 9(a)-(d) represent a smaller number of training steps than Figs. 9(e)-(f).\nThis aligns with our empirical observation that training models to uncover student background,\nlearning context, and coding skills requires significantly more time than training them on sim-\npler conversational improvements. Finally, the near-monotonic improvement on all benchmarks\nas training progresses allows the selection of checkpoints, which show clear improvement on all\nbenchmarks simultaneously (see Appendix D for an example).\n\n6.2 Human Evaluations\n\nIn addition to the large-scale automated evaluations outlined above, we also performed limited\nhuman evaluations of the resulting fine-tuned models to confirm the reported performance im-\nprovements. In these manual experiments, human testers (internal team members) impersonated\nstudents and entered into dialogues with the fine-tuned tutor model. This allowed us to directly\nobserve reduced verbosity and enhanced turn taking, a marked shift towards fewer but more open-\nended questions, a more natural flow of conversations, and clear improvement in context-setting\nand in-depth understanding of student background before diving into further tutoring activity. A\nrigorous, large-scale human evaluation of our fine-tuned models will be addressed in an upcoming\n\n16\n\n\freport.\n\n7 Conclusion\n\nIn this technical report, we analyzed the fundamental limitations of prompt-engineering LLMs\nfor education and outlined the importance of post-training frontier models on authentic learning\ndata. We introduced a novel framework for performing multi-turn evaluations on LLMs using a\nfine-tuned student model trained on authentic student data. We used our framework to quantify\nthe gap between frontier models and human tutors in terms of six conversational and pedagogical\nbenchmarks. We also showed that fine-tuning on authentic tutor data improved the performance\nof frontier models on all of our benchmarks.\n\n8 Outlook\n\nThis preliminary report focused on the supervised fine-tuning of frontier models, which is only\nthe first step in post-training of LLMs. Encouraged by these early results, we are now focused\non realizing the full benefit of post-training through reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF) [26], which is a natural next step given the availability of authentic learning dialogues\ninvolving humans.\n\nOur early efforts focused on establishing the simple, measurable benchmarks outlined in this re-\nport, but more sophisticated evaluations are needed to capture the full richness of human pedagogy.\nSpecifically, we will prioritize creating benchmarks that capture the nuances of longitudinal inter-\nactions between students and tutors. These types of interactions are only possible over extended\nperiods of time and are critical in fostering rapport and driving tangible learning outcomes.\n\nWe also note that evaluations in this report were focused on scalable and automated processes\nand (limited) human feedback from non-learners. Our aim is to scale and quantify student feedback\non actual model performance by incorporating post-trained models into the student journey on the\nPolygence platform.\n\n9 Acknowledgements\n\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with Hossein Talebi, Mike Tung, Rumen Dangovski, Peter\nDanenberg, Tony Wang, Kelvin Guu, James Kim, Ann Miura-Ko, Vinit Sukhija, Chris Piech, Irina\nJurenka, Hema Baja, Lisa Wang, Markus Kunesch, Veronica Edwards, Adam Gyulavari, and Daniel\nHorvath.\n\nThe PolyPilot experiment was created by Robert Beretka, Daniel Horvath, Ross Greer, Janos\nPerczel, Emma Leyden, Amanda Chagoya, Alex Armstrong, Abdelaziz Tina, Tamas Csaba Kadar.\n\nAuthor Information\n\nDr. Demszky\u2019s contribution to this publication was as a consultant and was not part of her Stanford\nUniversity duties and responsibilities.

The right-hand side shows the different pre-defined\nstages in the student-journey\n\n25\n\n\fPolyPilot was a high-conviction product bet in early 2024 to build an effective AI tutor for\nproject-based learning (\u201cresearch mentor\u201d) by prompt engineering GPT-4. PolyPilot was designed\nto be a ChatGPT-like interface, but adapted to the needs of students looking to complete a long-\nterm project (see screenshot in Fig. 8). The student journey was broken up into five distinct\nstages:\n\n\u2022 Provide check-in details \u2013 This stage focused on establishing context about the student\u2019s\n\nbackground, interests, and goals.\n\n\u2022 Choose your project destination \u2013 This stage helped students scope out their project\n\nidea.\n\n\u2022 Chart your trajectory \u2013 This stage guided the students through the background work\n\nneeded to complete the project.\n\n\u2022 Write your first draft \u2013 This stage focused on starting the writing process.\n\n\u2022 Announce your arrival \u2013 This stage helped students finish writing their artifact and show-\n\ncasing it to the public.\n\nFor each stage we customized our prompts and upon detecting stage completion, the prompt\nfor the next session was loaded on the backend. We iteratively refined the prompts to better\nalign GPT-4 with good pedagogy and to handle edge cases. Initially, we experimented with just\nfive prompts for the five distinct stages and the prompts quickly ballooned to 500-1000 words in\nlength. We observed severe limitations in GPT-4\u2019s ability to follow all instructions. Later, we broke\ndown each of the 4 stages into 3-6 distinct sub-stages and progressively refined the prompts to be\nonly 200-300 words. These improved the performance, but the overall pedagogical capabilities of\nthe product remained limited. To improve product quality and reliability, we introduced human\ncheckpoints where an actual tutor checked the progress of the students and decided whether the\nstudent would need to do more work before proceeding to the next stage. We found that these\nhuman checkpoints were helpful, but didn\u2019t fully address the underlying issues. The product was\nused by n = 71 students generating valuable data about student-AI interactions.\n\nB Observations on Anthropic\u2019s Learning Mode, OpenAI\u2019s Study\n\nMode, and Google\u2019s Guided Learning\n\nIn recent months, multiple model developers have released educational LLMs that have been\nprompt-engineered to improve their pedagogical behavior. To get a directional sense of their behav-\nior, we manually tested Anthropic\u2019s Learning Mode [28], OpenAI\u2019s Study Mode [29], and Google\u2019s\nGuided Learning [30] (which integrates LearnLM [31]). Topics ranged from solving simple quadratic\nequations, to learning Latin, to studying the advanced physics of black holes. Goals ranged from\nlearning new topics, to refining existing knowledge, to writing research papers. Among others, we\nfound the following patterns:\n\n\u2022 Missing learning context: All three models spend practically no time establishing the\nlearning context, such as the pre-existing level of understanding, the learning goal or the\nmotivation of the student. As a result, models dive quickly into discussions of specific topics\nthat may be inappropriate for the level of the student or drive towards outcomes that do not\nreflect the learning goal of the student. In cases where the model asked questions about the\nstudent\u2019s existing level of understanding, we found limited evidence that this was taken into\naccount during the conversation.\n\n26\n\n\f\u2022 Multiple-choice-style questioning: All three models appear to struggle with asking open-\nended questions, instead defaulting to multiple-choice style questions (typically 3) that dra-\nmatically restrict the space of choices. We theorize that this is a consequence of the un-\nderlying off-the-shelf model behavior that is learned from data containing bullet-point-style,\noverly-structured responses. This typically narrows the topics and/or course of action quickly\nwithout appropriately exploring the ideas and goals of the student.\n\n\u2022 One question per statement: We found that Gemini and GPT typically ask exactly\none question per statement (occasionally two), usually placed at the end of the statement,\nwhich we theorize is a simple consequence of a prompt instruction. While this behavior is\nan improvement over the large number of questions off-the-shelf models typically ask (see\nSection 5), this simple, static rule represents a coarse approximation of high-quality Socratic\nquestioning. (We found that Claude asks a large number of questions per statement similar\nto its off-the-shelf version.)\n\n\u2022 Wall of text: All three models are verbose (though less so than their off-the-shelf versions),\nwhich appears to get worse as the conversation progresses. We theorize that the underlying\ntraining data ingrains verbosity into models and the effectiveness of steering models towards\nbrevity with prompts diminishes as a progressively larger part of the context window is taken\nup by the conversation.\n\n\u2022 Inability to deal with confusion: Not giving away answers has been a prominent (and\npotentially over-simplified) focal point of improving LLMs for education. GPT appears to still\ngive away answers with minimal prompting. Gemini and Claude immediately and repeatedly\nrephrase and reexplain the question or problem when faced with confusion \u2013 making little\neffort to understand the source or level of the confusion.\n\nWe note that while each of the specific behaviors highlighted above could be improved through\ntargeted prompting, these issues are merely indicators of a larger issue with prompt engineering. As\nnoted previously (and highlighted in the LearnLM team\u2019s initial report [33]), prompt engineering\nalone is unlikely to fully encode the vast and complex space of effective tutoring, as it would require\nan exhaustive, context-specific rule-based description of all of good pedagogy \u2013 an impossible task\neven with unlimited context length.\n\nC Overlap of Polygence Data with Top Student Activities Re-\n\nported by OpenAI\n\nWe map the tutoring activities in our dataset to the top 27 categories of ChatGPT usage by 18-24\nyear old students, as reported by OpenAI [7]. We find that approximately 78% of our data overlaps\nwith the top 10 ChatGPT use cases by students. Table 2 below shows the specific percentage of\nstudents utilizing each of the top 10 activities on OpenAI\u2019s platform. We separately show whether\nthat activity is covered by our data.\n\nD Selecting a Checkpoint With Improved Performance Across All\n\nBenchmarks\n\nIn Section 6 we showed that models show general improvement across all selected benchmarks when\ntrained on authentic learning data. In Fig. 9 we choose a specific checkpoint and show that the\nfine-tuned version outperforms the base model on all six of the benchmarks simultaneously.\n\n27\n\n\fTop 10 ChatGPT Usage\nCategories by Students\n\nStarting papers/projects\nSummarize texts\nBrainstorm creative projects\nExplore topics\nEdit writing\nMathematical problem-solving\nExam preparation\nAcademic research\nTutoring\nEssay drafting\n\n% of Students Data Overlap\n\n49%\n48%\n45%\n42%\n42%\n39%\n36%\n34%\n32%\n32%\n\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2717\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\u2713\n\nTable 2: Overlap of Polygence data with the top 10 ChatGPT use cases by 18-24 year old students,\nas reported by OpenAI [7].\n\nFigure 9: Performance of a specific checkpoint a fine-tuned Gemini 2.0 model on all six benchmarks\nfrom Section 4.1.
